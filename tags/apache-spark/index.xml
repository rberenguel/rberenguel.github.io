      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have dropped the &lt;em&gt;Weekly&lt;/em&gt; from the title. It was about time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am on holidays (starting yesterday)! Two weeks of probably more programming than usual 🤣&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I should remove the &lt;em&gt;Weekly&lt;/em&gt; moniker of these posts and emails. They are done when they are done. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a week off, and this delayed this post by a week. So, this is a long one: have fun for the 50th edition!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An early one: For the first time in… not sure how, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a whole week off. Which implies &lt;em&gt;no computer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another hard push at reducing my reading list. At the current pace I may not write many more of these posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a hard push to clean up my reading list, deleting &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; and reading &lt;em&gt;another lot&lt;/em&gt;. It went from 369 items to 99 🎉&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lack of commute is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hard on my reading, and I have also been working on several projects that have eaten into my reading/writing time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The full lockdown edition. Almost no engineering &lt;code&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;. The lack of commute is hard on reading articles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No specific theme this week, but feels more data engineering heavy than lately. As it should. Oh, and beware door knobs, they can bring evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First edition of the New Year. As eclectic as usual, I hope. The audio-based monitoring of servers and the weird uses of the GPT-2 neural network could be two highlights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On time this week. Nothing remarkable: I&amp;rsquo;m winding down a bit my reading (both articles and books) in preparation for the yearly review and having some cooldown period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The map and problem described here were part of my presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping&#34;&gt;Mapping as a tool for thought&lt;/a&gt;, and mentioned in my interview with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jhngrant&#34;&gt;John Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BenMosior&#34;&gt;Ben Mosior&lt;/a&gt; (to appear sometime soon in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9-K9BLFozmmvmWzjyjkow&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps community youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;). I’m looking for ideas on how to make this map easier to understand and useful, so I posted it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.wardleymaps.com/t/rfc-a-section-of-a-map-of-the-data-engineering-space/452&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps Community forums requesting comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Testing and debugging Apache Airflow We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Airflow for almost a year (on my suggestion). I&amp;rsquo;m not super-happy with it, and testing it is one of the pain points.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how you slip once on a habit and everything goes crazy? Well, I’ve been 4 weeks without writing these, so here’s the accumulated reading from 4 weeks. Because, even if I don’t write it, I read a lot anyway. Also, there’s lot of interesting content this “week”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I have been working a lot with a relatively large dataset on a Spark shell. It was a graph with 1 billion nodes and 2 billion edges that I wanted to analyse with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/graphframes/graphframes&#34;&gt;GraphFrames&lt;/a&gt; (the successor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.1/graphx-programming-guide.html&#34;&gt;GraphX&lt;/a&gt; on Spark).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost two months ago (time sure flies) I attended for the second time the conference &lt;a href=&#34;https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8784-scala-exchange-2017&#34;&gt;Scala eXchange&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest Scala conferences in the world, and which happens to be 1 tube stop from the office you can find me from time to time in London.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2017: Year in Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I needed to parse configuration files in Scala for a Spark project and decided to use PureConfig. It is incredibly lean to use, needing minimal boilerplate. I recommend you check it out (give also a look at CaseClassy, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to test yet).
Everything seemed straightforward enough, and I got it working pretty quickly (as in, it compiled properly). The surprise? spark-submit failed with a conflict with Shapeless (lacking a witness).</description>
