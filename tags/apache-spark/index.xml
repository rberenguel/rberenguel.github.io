      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lack of commute is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hard on my reading, and I have also been working on several projects that have eaten into my reading/writing time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The full lockdown edition. Almost no engineering &lt;code&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;. The lack of commute is hard on reading articles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No specific theme this week, but feels more data engineering heavy than lately. As it should. Oh, and beware door knobs, they can bring evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Testing and debugging Apache Airflow We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Airflow for almost a year (on my suggestion). I&amp;rsquo;m not super-happy with it, and testing it is one of the pain points.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how you slip once on a habit and everything goes crazy? Well, I’ve been 4 weeks without writing these, so here’s the accumulated reading from 4 weeks. Because, even if I don’t write it, I read a lot anyway. Also, there’s lot of interesting content this “week”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I needed to parse configuration files in Scala for a Spark project and decided to use PureConfig. It is incredibly lean to use, needing minimal boilerplate. I recommend you check it out (give also a look at CaseClassy, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to test yet).
Everything seemed straightforward enough, and I got it working pretty quickly (as in, it compiled properly). The surprise? spark-submit failed with a conflict with Shapeless (lacking a witness).</description>
