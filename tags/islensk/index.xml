      <description>From my cheap dictionary
I love learning languages. Since I picked my first Teach yourself English (in Spanish) from my grandparents place when I was 10 years old, I have been fascinated by languages and language learning, first human languages and then also by computer languages.

Iceland is one of the few places
where you can park inside a
volcano
As you may remember, Laia and me spent three weeks in Iceland for holidays two months ago. You can read the day-by-day exploration with plenty of pictures by browsing the tag Iceland, which accounts our road trip.

      <description>As you may remember, Laia and me spent three weeks in Iceland for holidays two months ago. This is the first post in the series Things you should read about before travelling to Iceland. Be sure to stay tuned for the following posts!
First I would like to say you one thing about Iceland&amp;rsquo;s food: don&amp;rsquo;t be scared! They don&amp;rsquo;t eat anything odd, except for a few national foods which are not that usual: h√°kari (rotten shark meat) and hrutspungar (pickled ram testicles).</description>

      <description>Interesting things to know before going to Iceland As you may remember, Laia and myself went to Iceland for a 2 and half weeks trip last June-July. It was a wonderful experience, managed by the wonderful (and helpful!) people at Nordic Visitor. This is the first post in a series named Things you should read before travelling to Iceland. In these posts I will cover the following (I will add links to the individual posts here as I write them, bookmark this page!</description>

&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/08/things-you-should-read-before.html&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m travelling to Iceland this
July&lt;/a&gt;,
and started learning Icelandic a few months ago. It advances slowly but firmly,
but I found a problem:when you are self-learning a new language, an invaluable
tool is a list of most common words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
