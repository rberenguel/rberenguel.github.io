      <title>Crispy apple pie (similar to the Danish æblekage)</title>

      <description>A few days ago I found this recipe via StumbleUpon. I had two apples I would not eat, and decided to give it a go. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t have oatmeal, so I improvised. This is my version, which I call Crispy Apple Pie.
If you have ever been to Denmark, they eat something named Æblekage. I ate it last November, and I loved it. This is very, very similar&amp;hellip; with a little whipped cream it would be almost the same.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bet you have felt like this some day: You just prepared a soup, one of those
soups in need of crumbs of bread. Or you prepared a nice meal, asking for bread
to dump in the sauce. And you have no bread at home! Not a single piece of
bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the answer&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Name one great asset to your cupboard. One you can put in a pizza, in almost every salad, you can make omelets out of it, can put over a toast and could be a side dish to almost every meal you can think of. Well, sun dried tomatoes come close to it. Tasty, nice and they smell as good you get hungry just opening the jar. Well, they are really easy to do at home, with just your oven!</description>
