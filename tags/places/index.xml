      <description>Today I am leaving on holiday&amp;hellip; Destination: Iceland. It is funny, because we arranged everything (accomodation, car rental and such) just two weeks before Eyjafjallajökull started spitting ash. It have been a few months wondering whether we could make it to Iceland and come back&amp;hellip; Fortunately the little volcano took a pause and here we go.
I have a few scheduled posts for this few weeks (I&amp;rsquo;ll be back around 16th July) but I will be again posting more frequently after I am back.</description>

      <description>While on Paris, I spotted several Space Invaders. Sadly, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware enough, as there are plenty.</description>

      <description>Lavaurs algorithm on course
Like almost every year, August comes with a lot of pending To Do lists&amp;hellip; This year, it is choking full, mostly of work related issues, and some unknotted threads waiting to be finished. And in two and a half weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll head for Paris, and then my &amp;ldquo;vacation&amp;rdquo; is over.
Yesterday I wasted my morning: bought my orange belt, set up the external monitor for my netbook, configured the printer, fotocopied two pages of a book and drank an horchata with a friend.</description>

      <description>Here are some pictures and images which look pretty good together with my Fluxbox configuration, in my Netbook. Here they are for your enjoyment. They are supposed to be small, not to drain too many system resources. I will upload later the butterfly in higher resolution.

      <description>Last weekend we had a quick trip (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) to Madrid. Being a Barcelona lover, I thought I would hate the city. I was amazed after walking over there, having a look at all the monuments and museums (the tourist thing), and then going for dinner and supper, some tapas and a beer. Madrid surprised us with this&amp;hellip; in Barcelona is quite hard to find a cheap and good place to eat&amp;hellip; or not so cheap, but not tourist focused.</description>
