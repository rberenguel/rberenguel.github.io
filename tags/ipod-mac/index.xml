in an iPod Touch
All hail hypnotoad&amp;hellip; in real life
I want to start by saying that I might buy an iPad, and definitely like it, in an abstract setting. But I think that Steve Jobs is kind of blind through his own charisma. He likes the iPad&amp;hellip; then it should be liked (and bought) by everyone.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think the iPad is gona be a hit.</description>

      <description>Mathematician, Linux user, already had an iPod (iPod nano), recently bought a netbook. Why did I buy an iPod touch?
Papers for iPhone (7.99€): a organizer for research PDF&amp;rsquo;s with integrated PDF reader (allegedly optimized for research articles), with the ability to sync with the desktop app (29€, less with the 40% discount for students&amp;hellip; still waiting for it to buy it). Well, it lives up the expectations, although the desktop version is strange (used it only once, yet) and the syncing can be hard as the network settings may keep you from syncing.</description>
