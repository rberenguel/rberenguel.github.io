      <description>This was computed using PVM and the full PDF generated is 16k pixels wide
  Today is Iceland&amp;rsquo;s National Day (commemorating their independence day and the date of birth of Jón Sigurðsson), and to commemorate it I share this image with everyone.
I computed this image a long, long time ago (using the Distance Estimator Method, paralellised with PVM using 16 computers, it took just 2 minutes). The full file is a 30MB pdf, which I printed large-size (2 meters wide), and sits in my office.</description>

      <description>This is a picture I shot in Iceland, in the Dynjandi Waterfall. If a caption is needed, it would be Never give up. Click the thumbnails to download the high resolution images.

      <description>As I already did with Douady Rabbits, here is another dynamical plane, this time corresponding to a Siegel disk in an entire transcendental family in a parameter corresponding to a polynomial-like region.

      <description>I have been experimenting with exponential-power potentials in my fractal images as of late, and by far the best results have been these. You can download it as a desktop wallpaper, hope you enjoy it. This Douady rabbit appears as a capture zone for a critical value in an exponential family.
