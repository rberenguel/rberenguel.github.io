      <description>From my cheap dictionary
As a byproduct of The Language Switch, I was invited to send a guest post to Bitesize Irish Gaelic, a wonderful site where you can learn Irish gaelic online.
Last year I decided to learn Icelandic because we were going to Iceland, this year I was learning Gaelic&amp;hellip; Thus we decided that Ireland might be a good place to visit this summer on holidays, encouraging me to learn better this new language.</description>
