      <title>How does the &#39;in&#39; keyword work in Python?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days go I played a bit with a naive implementation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bloom
filters&lt;/a&gt; in Python. I wanted to time
them against just checking whether a field is in a set/collection. I found
something slightly puzzling: it looked like the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; worked &lt;em&gt;too fast&lt;/em&gt; for
smaller lists. And I wondered: maybe small lists are special internally, and
allow for really fast lookups? Maybe they have some internal index? This raised
the question: how does &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; find stuff &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; sequences?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Just as Mario: Using the Plan9 plumber utility</title>

      <description>Note: It&amp;rsquo;s best to open the videos in full screen. Also I have added a few line breaks or readability in the code snippets that will make them not work correctly. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to find where they are, if you run into any problems let me know.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following this blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll know I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Acme and related Plan 9 from User Space utilities lately. One of its pieces is the plumber.</description>

      <title>Version Control: Started using git and github (and how to set-up a remote git server)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 6 years since I used some kind of version control system. Back
then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about which I wanted to use… I settled with RCS, the father
of them all. RCS was structurally simple, with text-based (human-readable) delta
files. I liked that. I had all my code and TeX files under revision control, but
then I started using more than one computer and it got out of hand quickly
(using RCS or CVS in Windows was quite tricky and had user and encoding
problems.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
