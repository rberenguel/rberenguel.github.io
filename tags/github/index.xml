      <description>A subtitle to this post could be More yak shaving
A few days go I played a bit with a naive implementation of Bloom filters in Python. I wanted to time them against just checking whether a field is in a set/collection. I found something slightly puzzling: it looked like in worked too fast for smaller lists. And I wondered: maybe small lists are special internally, and allow for really fast lookups?</description>

      <description>I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say we, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.
Work Everything work related has gone up. More work, better work, more interesting work.</description>

      <description>Note: It&amp;rsquo;s best to open the videos in full screen. Also I have added a few line breaks or readability in the code snippets that will make them not work correctly. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to find where they are, if you run into any problems let me know.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following this blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll know I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Acme and related Plan 9 from User Space utilities lately. One of its pieces is the plumber.</description>

      <description>The Octocat, Github&amp;rsquo;s logo
It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 6 years since I used some kind of revision control system. Back then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about which I wanted to use&amp;hellip; I settled with RCS, the father of them all. RCS was structurally very simple, with text-based (human-readable) delta files. I liked that. I had all my code and TeX files under revision control, but then I started using more than one computer and it got out of hand very quickly (using RCS or CVS in Windows was quite tricky and had user and encoding problems.</description>
