      <description>This week I have been working a lot with a relatively large dataset on a Spark shell. It was a graph with 1 billion nodes and 2 billion edges that I wanted to analyse with GraphFrames (the successor of GraphX on Spark). This is quite large: before running the graph algorithms I did some exploratory analysis, and each step took at least 10 minutes. Checking stage/task progress bars or generated analysis plans is only interesting for the first fee&amp;hellip; I wanted a way to get a subtle notification when the process finished.</description>

      <description>It would probably be an understatement to say I&amp;rsquo;m not a gamer. Last console I got was a Game Boy, 22 years ago (IIRC). Never got a gaming PC. I have 4 games on my Mac, and one is ASCII based. But my main source of mindless leisure for the past 7 years, aside from reading, has been playing with some iDevice. From an iPod Touch back then to my current iPhone and iPad Pro, playing, for me, has been Apple.</description>
