      <description>A few weeks ago I saw in my Google Analytics that someone came to this blog looking for &amp;ldquo;Origami iPhone case&amp;rdquo;. As I have a Origami CD case, and several posts on iPhone/iPod Touch games&amp;hellip; it was a page hit. But I thought: if I can have a neat CD case, I can also design a neat origami case for an iPhone! Said and&amp;hellip; done. It took a few tries (and a few days), as you can see below.</description>
