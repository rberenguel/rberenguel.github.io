      <description>&lt;p&gt;The map and problem described here were part of my presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping&#34;&gt;Mapping as a tool for thought&lt;/a&gt;, and mentioned in my interview with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jhngrant&#34;&gt;John Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BenMosior&#34;&gt;Ben Mosior&lt;/a&gt; (to appear sometime soon in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9-K9BLFozmmvmWzjyjkow&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps community youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;). I’m looking for ideas on how to make this map easier to understand and useful, so I posted it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.wardleymaps.com/t/rfc-a-section-of-a-map-of-the-data-engineering-space/452&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps Community forums requesting comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you have have known me for any length of time you&amp;rsquo;ll know I write mostly Python and Scala lately (Rust is getting into the mix slowly). And you should know, I am a heavy emacs user. I have been using emacs for close to 15 years, for the past 3 my emacs of choice has been spacemacs. I used to have a very long, customised and complex .emacs and with spacemacs I get a mostly-batteries-included package.</description>

Testing and debugging Apache Airflow We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Airflow for almost a year (on my suggestion). I&amp;rsquo;m not super-happy with it, and testing it is one of the pain points.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how you slip once on a habit and everything goes crazy? Well, I’ve been 4 weeks without writing these, so here’s the accumulated reading from 4 weeks. Because, even if I don’t write it, I read a lot anyway. Also, there’s lot of interesting content this “week”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A subtitle to this post could be More yak shaving
A few days go I played a bit with a naive implementation of Bloom filters in Python. I wanted to time them against just checking whether a field is in a set/collection. I found something slightly puzzling: it looked like in worked too fast for smaller lists. And I wondered: maybe small lists are special internally, and allow for really fast lookups?</description>

      <description>I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say we, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.
Work Everything work related has gone up. More work, better work, more interesting work.</description>

At last February. Finished my PhD dissertation, so can add Dr. in front of my name when ordering a Gatwick Express train ticket. Also makes for a cooler email signature. So far has been the only differences I’ve seen in the year

      <description>Last week I wrote about whatlanguageis.com, my first simple try at creating a Django powered site. How did it came to be?
In the last few months have been writing and thinking about several ideas to process social data with Python, undoubtedly motivated by the great book Mining the Social Web. In the back of my mind, I wanted my code to work as a web application (either for me or for others,) and thought that I should comply with everyone else, learn PHP and try to make Python and PHP be friends.</description>

      <title>Language Detection in Python with NLTK Stopwords</title>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding a little more Python than usual, some twitter API stuff, some data crunching code. The other day I was thinking how I could detect the language a twitter user was writing in. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there is a library out there that does it&amp;hellip; But the NLTK library (the Natural Language Toolkit for Python) does not have any function for this, or at least I was not able to find it after 5 minutes of Google search.</description>
