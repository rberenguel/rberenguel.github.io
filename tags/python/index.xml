      <title>A context manager to measure elapsed time?</title>
      <link>https://mostlymaths.net/2020/01/context-managing-time.html/</link>

      <guid>https://mostlymaths.net/2020/01/context-managing-time.html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around a year ago (give or take a few months), I was talking with a coworker about context managers, and a question arose: could you use a context manager to measure elapsed time? I stashed the question away, and created a project &lt;em&gt;Timing Context Manager&lt;/em&gt;, which I actively ignored for many months. New year, new me, and a conversation with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/marcraminv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marc Ramírez&lt;/a&gt; moved me to unblock some of my old projects. This was the easiest project I had in Python, so I moved it to active.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First edition of the New Year. As eclectic as usual, I hope. The audio-based monitoring of servers and the weird uses of the GPT-2 neural network could be two highlights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On time this week. Nothing remarkable: I&amp;rsquo;m winding down a bit my reading (both articles and books) in preparation for the yearly review and having some cooldown period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mixed bag of interesting history tidbits sprinkled with Haskell code, Scala
stuff, data engineering systems and practices, and how to code with your voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This feels like a heavy engineering edition. A lot of Haskell, Rust, Python and
Scala. There’s still a bit of everything, but this will appeal hardcore
developers more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some data engineering, a bit of Haskell, programming music, Python and random
bits and bobs. I recommend you play with the third. Several good books this
week, as I have ramped up my reading: current goal would be 52 this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit of Python, some more Rust and the usual randomness. The first one looks
tasty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although this week I have been reading mostly Apache Cassandra documentation, I
have tried to avoid an onslaught of tips, tricks and readings on it. Just one

I’m looking for ideas on how to make this map easier to understand and useful, so I posted it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.wardleymaps.com/t/rfc-a-section-of-a-map-of-the-data-engineering-space/452&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps Community forums requesting comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you have have known me for any length of time you&amp;rsquo;ll know I write mostly Python and Scala lately (Rust is getting into the mix slowly). And you should know, I am a heavy emacs user. I have been using emacs for close to 15 years, for the past 3 my emacs of choice has been spacemacs. I used to have a very long, customised and complex .emacs and with spacemacs I get a mostly-batteries-included package.</description>

Because, even if I don’t write it, I read a lot anyway. Also, there’s lot of interesting content this “week”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days go I played a bit with a naive implementation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bloom
filters&lt;/a&gt; in Python. I wanted to time
them against just checking whether a field is in a set/collection. I found
something slightly puzzling: it looked like the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; worked &lt;em&gt;too fast&lt;/em&gt; for
smaller lists. And I wondered: maybe small lists are special internally, and
allow for really fast lookups? Maybe they have some internal index? This raised
the question: how does &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; find stuff &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; sequences?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At last February. Finished my PhD dissertation, so can add Dr. in front of my name when ordering a Gatwick Express train ticket. Also makes for a cooler email signature. So far has been the only differences I’ve seen in the year

      <description>Last week I wrote about whatlanguageis.com, my first simple try at creating a Django powered site. How did it came to be?
In the last few months have been writing and thinking about several ideas to process social data with Python, undoubtedly motivated by the great book Mining the Social Web. In the back of my mind, I wanted my code to work as a web application (either for me or for others,) and thought that I should comply with everyone else, learn PHP and try to make Python and PHP be friends.</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding a little more Python than usual, some twitter API stuff, some data crunching code. The other day I was thinking how I could detect the language a twitter user was writing in. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there is a library out there that does it… But the NLTK library (the Natural Language Toolkit for Python) does not have any function for this, or at least I was not able to find it after 5 minutes of Google search.</description>
