      <title>Moving from Emacs to Spacemacs</title>

      <description>A couple of days ago I attended (first time I managed in almost 6 months) the London chapter of the Emacs Church (also known as the local meetup for emacs lovers). In this event we were shown how to use emacs effectively for Clojure development (using Cider) and I saw in real life Spacemacs.
In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, Spacemacs is a &amp;ldquo;distribution&amp;rdquo; of Emacs prepared (is open source, of course) to be easy to setup, and somehow specially prepared for former Vim users to move to Emacs.</description>

      <description>Text editors. You hate them or love them. Praise them with religious zeal, and attack them with the same power. I&amp;rsquo;ve been an emacs user for the last 8 years, getting as deep as I could without checking the source. And the past few months I have started using evil-mode in emacs, to get some taste of vim in my daily editing (mostly text objects.)
There&amp;rsquo;s still a third contestant in editor-land, for me.</description>

      <description>The links to Practical Vim are affiliate links to Amazon. Beware!
So&amp;hellip; last January I was in a flight to London, preparing for an intense, 12 days course on traditional shoemaking (English hand-welted shoes, improving our knowledge at The Fancy Puffin.) And my flight read was Practical Vim. Most of my readers are already aware I&amp;rsquo;m an emacs guy, so the main question is why?
I love knowing many tools.</description>

A few months ago I wrote about how I&amp;rsquo;m using vim in my ipad. You know, I&amp;rsquo;m an emacs guy, just started writing my own (useful) stuff to improve it. Recently I finished gnusnotes.el, a package which allows you to easily add notes to emails. Of course, before this I had already written emacs code, just that it was only for me.</description>
