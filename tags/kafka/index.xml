      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week we were on holidays 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a few days in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaqu%C3%A9s&#34;&gt;Cadaqués&lt;/a&gt;, a small coastal town in the north of Catalonia. We ate extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2017: Year in Review</title>
      <link>https://mostlymaths.net/2018/01/2017-year-in-review.html/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>October Kafka London Meetup - Jay Kreps: Distributed stream processing with Apache Kafka</title>

      <description>This has been the first time I could attend the Apache Kafka meetup in London. Previous meetings had me in Barcelona or flying. First realisation: it is a surprisingly crowded meetup! Clearly, everyone is using Kafka, even if it is not clear from the outside. Oh, and the food was pretty good, too. Thanks to the sponsor (which I have sadly forgotten).
I really enjoyed this one. The speaker was Jay Kreps, CEO and co-founder of Confluent (and author of I Heart Logs), so, basically, a Kafka top committer himself.</description>
