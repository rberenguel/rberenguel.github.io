      <description>A few months ago (woah, so long already!) I had an impulse buy: I purchased a circular slide rule from Etsy. It was cheap, and I had always wanted one, so&amp;hellip; I just bought it (a neat addition to my Addiator.)
I guess if you are geeky enough to read mostlymaths.net, you know how a slide rule works. Although I knew how to use it, getting to grips with it took a little while.</description>

No, this is not a tutorial (but I do have written the standard steps to learn below). I began learning to juggle very recently. I just want to answer a possible &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;?
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by juggling, and every time I wanted to eat more than 2 small oranges I&amp;rsquo;d try my hand at juggling them. Always followed by bowing and picking them from the ground, of course.</description>
