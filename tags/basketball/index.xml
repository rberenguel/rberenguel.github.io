      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been pretty busy lately, and although reading doesnâ€™t stop, my writing sometimes takes a hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data engineering, adtech, history, apple. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag here](&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek,&#34;&gt;https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek,&lt;/a&gt; Readings) . You can also get these as a weekly newsletter by subscribing &lt;a href=&#34;http://eepurl.com/geFw7P&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rasterbator: online posterizer for @home printing</title>

      <description>My chair, my fractals (A4) and my Drazen
Petrovic poster (4xA4)
Rasterbator is an online poster maker, for you to print in your own printer. Of course, the results are not as good as full quality posters like these, but they look pretty good when looked from afar. It rasterises an image you upload (or link from anywhere in Internet), does some magic stuff, and the result is a bunch (you decide graphically how many, orientation and other options) of A4 (or Legal) sheets arranged in a nice PDF, which you have to print.</description>
