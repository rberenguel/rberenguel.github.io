      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been on quite the hiatus, making this more of a &lt;em&gt;readings of the month&lt;/em&gt;
edition. Sorry!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been pretty busy lately, and although reading doesn’t stop, my writing sometimes takes a hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data engineering, adtech, history, apple. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how you slip once on a habit and everything goes crazy? Well, I’ve been 4 weeks without writing these, so here’s the accumulated reading from 4 weeks. Because, even if I don’t write it, I read a lot anyway. Also, there’s lot of interesting content this “week”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you know me, you&amp;rsquo;ll know I have a quite extensive reading list. I keep it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of my to do stored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://culturedcode.com/things/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Things3&lt;/a&gt;. It used to be &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; (hovering around 230 items since August) but during Christmas it got out of control, reaching almost 300 items.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Processing from Scala</title>
      <link>https://mostlymaths.net/2018/03/processing-and-scala.html/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 17:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mostlymaths.net/2018/03/processing-and-scala.html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had always wanted to play with Processing (after leafing through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Processing-Programming-Handbook-Designers-Artists/dp/026202828X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1520004355&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=processing+handbook&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;amp;linkId=08457cedf1bdf882589a65f2a56c181b&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The
Processing
Handbook&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Data-Explaining-Processing-Environment/dp/0596514557/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;amp;linkId=3aa08467e0b53ce75e261bf7a9d7cf3c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Visualizing
Data&lt;/a&gt;
some years ago). My general dislike for Java or the JVM made me just play a
short amount of time with &lt;code&gt;processing.js&lt;/code&gt; something around 2011 (there was a
&lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; processing.js application for iOS, I used it for a while on my iPad and
iPod Touch).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://mostlymaths.net/2018/02/scala-exchange-2017.html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost two months ago (time sure flies) I attended for the second time the conference &lt;a href=&#34;https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8784-scala-exchange-2017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scala eXchange&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest Scala conferences in the world, and which happens to be 1 tube stop from the office you can find me from time to time in London.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At last February. Finished my PhD dissertation, so can add Dr. in front of my name when ordering a Gatwick Express train ticket. Also makes for a cooler email signature. So far has been the only differences I’ve seen in the year
Work February-December Started working as a consultant in London, almost the day after delivering the PhD presentation.</description>

      <description>Started a long time ago. It was supposed to be about a phenomenon leading to chaos: separatrix splitting. I got a research grant. I worked on holomorphic dynamics. Travelled. Presented. Too many roadblocks with the separatrix problem. Switched topics. Welcome to a different new world, infinite dimensional dynamical systems. I read the literature. Researched, proved some things. My grant ran out. I worked. A lot. Too many times I considered giving up.</description>

      <description>Back in the days of yore, when I was switching between my Windows machine and a Linux machine, I remember having SyncTeX active in my Windows machine. It was a wonderful experience: SyncTeX lets you click anywhere on a generated file from LaTeX and gets back to your editor, to the place generating where you clicked. This was extremely useful, specially later on when you need to adjust many formulas to fit and you need a bit of back-and-forth-ing.</description>

      <title>The Mandelbrot set in one line of APL</title>
      <link>https://mostlymaths.net/2014/01/the-mandelbrot-set-in-one-line-of-apl.html/</link>

      <description>Is this line noise?

⍉&amp;#39; *&amp;#39;[⍎&amp;#39;1+0&amp;lt;|z&amp;#39;,(∊150⍴⊂&amp;#39;←c+m×m&amp;#39;),&amp;#39;←c←(¯2.1J¯1.3+(((2.6÷b-1)×(¯1+⍳b))∘.+(0J1×(2.6÷b-1)×(¯1+⍳b←51))))&amp;#39;] Nope. This is not line noise, but a complete APL program to display the Mandelbrot set in glorious ASCII, with asterisks and spaces just like Brooks and Matelski did a long time ago while studying Kleinian groups (it&amp;rsquo;s a short paper, read it someday). I&amp;rsquo;ll explain in (a lot, I hope) detail this line in a few moments. So, what&amp;rsquo;s APL first?</description>

      <description>A few months ago (woah, so long already) I had an impulse buy: I purchased a circular slide rule from Etsy. It was cheap, and I had always wanted one, so… I just bought it (a neat addition to my Addiator.)
I guess if you are geeky enough to read mostlymaths.net, you know how a slide rule works. Although I knew how to use it, getting to grips with it took a little while.</description>

      <description>Taken from Flickr
  In case you have not realised it yet, I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty prolific reader. Online reading (and having an iPad) have slowed down the number of books I read in a given year, and I don&amp;rsquo;t go to the lengths of my girlfriend (who is about to reach her goal of reading 102 books in this year,) I&amp;rsquo;m nevertheless a frequent reader.
This year I&amp;rsquo;ve read several good books that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you, after all, if you are reading this probably our tastes overlap.</description>

Today is Iceland&amp;rsquo;s National Day (commemorating their independence day and the date of birth of Jón Sigurðsson), and to commemorate it I share this image with everyone.
I computed this image a long, long time ago (using the Distance Estimator Method, paralellised with PVM using 16 computers, it took just 2 minutes). The full file is a 30MB pdf, which I printed large-size, and sits in my office.</description>

      <description>Last Tuesday I presented a talk in a congress, here in Barcelona. This post is not about this talk, but about the Mac remote and Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo;. If you are interested, you can download the talk here, anyway.
As the congress was local, instead of using my netbook for the talk I brought my MacBook. Instead of using arrow keys, I could use these fancy Apple remotes. Good plan&amp;hellip; at the moment.</description>

      <description>Next week is the final exam of the course I&amp;rsquo;m giving, Numerical Analysis. Classes finished before Christmas, and this week is for students questions. I had one of these sessions this morning, when a pair of students came with a few questions related to the problems I solved on the blackboard.
All were quick to solve, until one simple question arose, concerning a trivial problem in Calculus 1 (or Analysis 1, as we name it here).</description>

The Design of the Emacs Logo
As you may already know, emacs is more than a (cross-platform) text editor. Some say that it is like a whole operating system (and some devil worshippers say that it lacks a good text editor&amp;hellip;). For the next 30 days (starting December 1, 2010) I&amp;rsquo;ll check it as well as I can. I will work just with emacs.

      <description>Hi readers! (woah&amp;hellip; 235 already! I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you&amp;rsquo;re here with me!)
This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Warsaw for a workshop (as I already commented in last post when I talked about the poster I am presenting).
I was expecting to use idle hours between talks and afternoons to write posts and post a little&amp;hellip; But my internet connection is inexistent. This post is coming from an open wifi connection, which gets connected and disconnected at random, and when at its peak, just makes 3Kb/s.</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;ll be in a workshop on Complex Dynamics in Warsaw, and will present a poster titled Approximating bifurcation loci by zeros of functions. This is heavily based on a poster I presented last year in Copenhagen (titled Sets approximating regions of instability). The underlying work in progress has changed quite a bit since then, but this does not show in the poster. I just solve some problems in the exposition, from the questions I got back then.</description>

Reading research papers can be a huge waste of time&amp;hellip; Or end up in forming big piles of To be read someday. The problem is, usually someday never means today.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago it was the beginning of this years lectures. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m solving problems in the blackboard, 2 hours per week and take care of one computer lab (programming in C, but they have already done a C programming course and another course of numerical computations with C), all for our Numerical Analysis course (7th semester). This is the same schedule I had 3 years ago, also last year I had one computer lab each semester.</description>

      <description>Yacas is an advanced computer algebra system, with its own programming language and a lot of handful operators available.
It comes handy when you need to do that odd symbolic computation which is too big to handle by hand (or you are plain lazy).
By looking at the wikipedia entry, I discovered an startling truth: as of 2009, yacas is no longer maintained.
I should have guessed, because yacas does not compile out of the box (the program needed to generate the manuals does not compile), and this led to some naïve patching (just removing all instances of said program&amp;hellip;).</description>

I own two books by him (Mathematical aspects of classical and celestial mechanics [1] and Mathematical methods of classical mechanics [2]), and are quite high in my list of most checked books, at least when I was starting my journey into the realm of dynamical systems.</description>

Several complex dynamic ideas: Unrelated to my thesis, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about them these days.</description>

      <description>As I wrote in a previous post, I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to learn forth, and to do so, rewrite my Lispy raytracer into a.. Forthy raytracer. Of course, the first steps are deciding on some implementation ideas.
I decided to allocate a few global variables (for &amp;ldquo;current point&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;current vector&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;light source&amp;rdquo;, etc), to avoid too much clutter in the stack. This way it will be cleaner, maybe even cleaner than my Lisp version.</description>

      <description>Maybe you remember my previous post about detection of copied assignments? Well, now I can say it succeeded. CJuicer is a flex script, generating a lexycal analyzer with a rudimentary parser of C code, it outputs a PostScript with the &amp;ldquo;logical tree&amp;rdquo; of loops, function calls and conditionals. Same trees, copied assignment (unless it is a very simple code&amp;hellip; then almost everyone writes the same), without problems with changing names of variables.</description>

      <description>As I said in a previous post, I am looking for some way to detect copied code. I have now a working prototype of a &amp;ldquo;code juicer&amp;rdquo;. From a C file it creates a set of PostScript files (well, almost, as they need postprocessing) which are later processed and selected to print. As an example, here is the output applied to a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4-5.

It is something like an execution tree, with function calls squared, and different slopes for if, for, while clauses.</description>

      <description>Pieces of an ENIGMA machine, from Flickr
Assume you have a set of alumni, which are due an individual programming assignment. All have the same assignment (as it is hard to come up with several), and it is hard enough that copying from each other passes for everyone&amp;rsquo;s mind. As a teacher, how do you detect this?
From my point of view, there are fundamentally two different kinds of copy:</description>

  Note from 2019: I can&amp;rsquo;t find the final version of that poster, only a modified version from a few months later for another conference.
The first piece of advise, is to set page guides where needed (in the Page menu, you can put them at a certain numerical place, and then move them along) and then Snap to guides in the same menu.</description>

Well, it lives up the expectations, although the desktop version is strange (used it only once, yet) and the syncing can be hard as the network settings may keep you from syncing.</description>

      <description>My month, starting
For the last two years, I have been really happy, living without a definite calendar. I just knew I had a meeting with my boss &amp;ldquo;next Monday&amp;rdquo;, or had a workshop somewhere &amp;ldquo;in the last weeks of January&amp;rdquo;. But these days I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize I just need a calendar now&amp;hellip; And finally managed to mix org-mode&amp;rsquo;s events with standard emacs calendar+diary views. This calendar is emacs calendar&amp;rsquo;s mode standard one (I love its looks) but harvests information from org-mode&amp;rsquo;s headlines and timestamps.</description>

September is to months as Monday is to weekdays
September is again here, like a new year in more than a sense. I have no new &amp;ldquo;New Year&amp;rsquo;s promises&amp;rdquo;, since the beginning of the year. In fact, most of the things I wanted to do are already done, on the way to be done or I gave up. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s summarize what I shall do these three months to end 2009</description>

I have a Lisp program running inside Slime (The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) in an emacs instance running in my office computer.</description>

      <description>These days I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy programming a version of Lavaurs algorithm for the idenfication of circle chords: the abstract Mandelbrot set.
The images don&amp;rsquo;t look like much, but the output of the program is nicer: it outputs an Encapsulated PostScript file which looks sharper. But when converting to png with ImageMagick some distortion appeared.

Sometimes I view mathematical knowledge as a desert. Full of sand, some pebbles, some rocks. You can get easily lost in this dry sea, but you can also find a place to stay and add. And now, I can say I have added my small grain of sand: An entire transcendental family with a persistent Siegel disc (link to the preprint version in ArXiV). My first article, now officially &amp;ldquo;Awaiting Editorial Assistant Processing&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Lavaurs algorithm on course
Like almost every year, August comes with a lot of pending To Do lists&amp;hellip; This year, it is choking full, mostly of work related issues, and some unknotted threads waiting to be finished. And in two and a half weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll head for Paris, and then my &amp;ldquo;vacation&amp;rdquo; is over.
Yesterday I wasted my morning: bought my orange belt, set up the external monitor for my netbook, configured the printer, fotocopied two pages of a book and drank an horchata with a friend.</description>

This means quite a lot of hand-written papers, full of definitions and on top of it all a lot of notational problems. I have quite a few similarly named spaces, with its corresponding norms&amp;hellip; It is a mess.
When I had already proved my &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; theorem (in the thesis context, I mean&amp;hellip; I have a paper soon to be published :), I started LaTeXing it.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s call transitive preference a way to sort all these elements, with draws possible. It&amp;rsquo;s just a funny name for a vote, in the more general sense as we can split our vote (Let A have 0.5, B 0.25 and C 0.25 of our vote).</description>

      <description>This evening I was bored at home, and decided to have a look at my old Lisp raytracer… a project that just went idle a year ago. I picked up another programming project I had idling for a long time (an emacs lisp project, to interact with my console-based fractal drawers). I had a coding breakthrough that time, and managed to advance quite a bit in a little time, so today I tried again.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I feel like a character from a RPG (or NetHack), where you have a certain level and experience, and as you advance killing monsters, your experience points go up, your level eventually rises and your enemies turn harder.
I guess life (or at least a mathematician&amp;rsquo;s life while doing his thesis) is more or less like this&amp;hellip; Enemies appear, you overcome them, and as you advance, they get stronger, bigger and thicker.</description>

      <description>Setting a local proxy through a remote machine
To set up a local proxy using some computer in another network (in my case, my office computer to accessing MathSciNet search and such), go to a console and
 ssh -D 42 YourRemoteMachineName
 And then set Firefox to use a proxy. In preferences, go to the Advanced Tab and select Connection Settings. Here you should select manual proxy configuration, in localhost with the same port number (42 in this example) as you used up before.</description>

   Bookbinding for dummies As of late, I have been printing quite a lot of long mathematical papers, and a few free pdf-books, or tutorials. And I wanted them properly bound, but didn&amp;rsquo;t want them so much as to pay for it. A few months ago, I found this tutorial on hardback binding. Although the tutorial, method and result are great, it is quite a lengthy effort.</description>

      <description>If you are printing a lot of… well, anything, sure you would love to make booklets out of what you print. If you happen to be a mathematician, you sure are printing lots of papers with more than 20 pages, which turn to 10 unmanageable pages when double-sided. But making a booklet allows you to turn them to just a little folded thing that you can read easier.
When printing in MacOSX you can print booklets, but they are supposed to be cut, not folded across as you would do to bind a book.</description>

Three fine speakers came (Walter Bergweiler, Agnieszka Badenska and Kari Astala), each one giving a course about a different topic in 3 sessions of one hour and a half. The only course I completed was the one Walter was giving, as it was the most interesting for me.
I talked on monday afternoon, but my talk was a mess.</description>
