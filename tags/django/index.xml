      <description>Note from 2020: The domain mentioned in the post is no longer active (or mine at least), I cancelled this project some time ago

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding a little more Python than usual, some twitter API stuff, some data crunching code. The other day I was thinking how I could detect the language a twitter user was writing in.
