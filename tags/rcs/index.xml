      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 6 years since I used some kind of version control system. Back
then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about which I wanted to useâ€¦ I settled with RCS, the father
of them all. RCS was structurally simple, with text-based (human-readable) delta
files. I liked that. I had all my code and TeX files under revision control, but
then I started using more than one computer and it got out of hand quickly
(using RCS or CVS in Windows was quite tricky and had user and encoding
problems.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
