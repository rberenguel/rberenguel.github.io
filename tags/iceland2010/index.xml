      <description>In Back to the Future, Doc sets the clock in the DeLorean to a day 25 years in the future. Today (2010, 6th July) is that day.
 Today was a really amazing day. It was very sunny, and we visited Ísafjörður, a city that stole our hearts.
Holmavík&amp;rsquo;s Witchcraft Museum, Reykjanes We started our day with breakfast and taking a quick picture of Drangsnes&amp;rsquo; Rock troll. It does not look like a troll for us, but anyway.</description>

      <description>As you may remember, yesterday we were not happy with our guest house. And in addition to what we saw yesterday, today our breakfast was d––n late. When you are driving around a country trying to be on time everywhere, you wake up early and drive a lot. If your breakfast is late, you are bound to either go faster (not a good idea in Iceland) or get to places later.</description>

      <description>Hólar&amp;rsquo;s church, if I&amp;rsquo;m not wrong
I&amp;rsquo;ve been procrastinating a lot with this post. Although it may not look like this from the pictures (or even the text), this was one of the worse days in our trip. Uneventful, visiting not-so-interesting places and with a lousy guest house at the end of the day. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if you find if interesting! If not, the next post will be, don&amp;rsquo;t worry.</description>

      <title>Road Trip Through Iceland: Day 8 - From Mývatn to Husavik visiting Ásbyrgi and Dettifoss</title>

      <description>No more gas ahead
Leaving Mývatn was a little dull. We saw a pair of handcraft stores that looked really interesting&amp;hellip; And they were closed until 11! No way we could spend so much time waiting. We fueled, bought vanillated skyr for the route and took the road to Dettifoss. This is one of those places where you definitely have to fuel, there is no other gas station in 130km.</description>

      <description>The Myvatn area
This weeks post in the Iceland road trip series comes a little late: Saturday was a relaxation day, and Sunday I posted about how relaxing Saturday felt. As such, I didn&amp;rsquo;t put the time to typeset this post until Friday was looming! I think I got a little out of hand adding pictures to this post&amp;hellip; But the Mývatn area is impressive and I wanted to show it here.</description>

      <description>Geese in the East Fjords, Iceland
In the last 2 weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve had a big surge of visits and new subscribers, following the rise in HackerNews of my old post Timeboxing: You Will Work Like Never Before and of my newer post Learn to Remember Everything: The Memory Palace Technique. To put in situation, last July my girlfriend and me made a road trip around Iceland, and I wrote everything we did each day.</description>

      <description>Happy World Water Day! Luckily the post due for today was a lot of water in it, iced water sparkling of thousand years old blue ice. This was supposed to be our puffin visit day&amp;hellip; But schedules played badly on us and we could not make it. We just made another round of Jökulsárlón icebergs while collecting shoreside rocks.
Expat tales While we were having breakfast we saw another guest in the lovely guesthouse at Hofell&amp;hellip; and he surprised us by asking if we were Catalans, in Catalan!</description>

      <description>Svartifoss, Iceland
Today (i.e. this day in our trip) was Laia&amp;rsquo;s birthday, and one of our personal landmarks in this trip, as we visited our favourite places: Svartifoss, my special place and Jökulsárlón, a place Laia loves. We spent almost all day in these two places and driving around, but they are probably two of the most remarkable experiences of our road trip in Iceland.
Kirkjugolf and Skaftafell Today we managed to visit the church&amp;rsquo;s floor, the Kirkjugolf.</description>

This is the journal of our road trip around Iceland, what we did each day as we circled the island through the Ring Road. This series of posts started on February 2011, and is so far ongoing, posting once a week from our annotations and pictures. Bookmark this page if you want to come back to see what&amp;rsquo;s new.

      <description>After visiting the wonders of the Golden Circle, we kept driving eastward getting into the region of waterfalls and glaciers. The day began with 2000 Icelandic krónur of fuel, that for 1&amp;frasl;4 of the tank. Expensive, but not as expensive as one may guess, from prices in Spain. It continued with the first sighting of lambs in the middle of the road&amp;hellip; Get used to that, it is very common!</description>

      <description>The Kerid crater. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss it!
This was the official first day. We did a quick packing and preparing in our room and headed downstairs. Breakfast time, and we were amused to find a bunch of Spanish hiking tourists, with a Spanish guide. Had a wonderful breakfast with some tips from the guide: Beware of falling over the side of the road. Why? Because you can be easily distracted by the landscape!</description>

      <description>﻿ / 64.133; -21.933

After a huge delay, this is the first of a few posts about our road trip to Iceland last June and July. While we were there, I wrote a journal about what we did and saw each day, and this is the extended version (with pictures!)
We arrived to Keflavík International Airport (its terminal is named Leifur Eiríksson after the European discoverer of North America), really late: our plane needed refueling before departure and it ate quite a lot of time.</description>
