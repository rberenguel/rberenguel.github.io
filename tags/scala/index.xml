      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a hard push to clean up my reading list, deleting &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; and reading &lt;em&gt;another lot&lt;/em&gt;. It went from 369 items to 99 🎉&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A flight last Sunday meant I was so sleepy I skipped sending last week&amp;rsquo;s newsletter… so this week is super-sized. A lot of content about distributed teams I think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I skipped last week. On Saturday &lt;a href=&#34;http://pybcn.org&#34;&gt;Python Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;
organised &lt;a href=&#34;https://pybcn.org/pyday-bcn-2019/&#34;&gt;PyDay 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and I was one of the
organisers aside from giving &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/pyspark_workshop&#34;&gt;a workshop on
PySpark&lt;/a&gt;, so I felt pretty tired
on Sunday. Of course this means this is a double issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week there is a lot of functional programming (mostly Scala, a bit of
Haskell) and data engineering topics. Of course, there is also the usual random
stuff I find interesting as well (and other engineering topics).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mixed bag of interesting history tidbits sprinkled with Haskell code, Scala
stuff, data engineering systems and practices, and how to code with your voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This feels like a heavy engineering edition. A lot of Haskell, Rust, Python and
Scala. There’s still a bit of everything, but this will appeal hardcore
developers more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although this week I have been reading mostly Apache Cassandra documentation, I
have tried to avoid an onslaught of tips, tricks and readings on it. Just one

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The map and problem described here were part of my presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping&#34;&gt;Mapping as a tool for thought&lt;/a&gt;, and mentioned in my interview with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jhngrant&#34;&gt;John Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BenMosior&#34;&gt;Ben Mosior&lt;/a&gt; (to appear sometime soon in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9-K9BLFozmmvmWzjyjkow&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps community youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;). I’m looking for ideas on how to make this map easier to understand and useful, so I posted it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.wardleymaps.com/t/rfc-a-section-of-a-map-of-the-data-engineering-space/452&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps Community forums requesting comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you have have known me for any length of time you&amp;rsquo;ll know I write mostly Python and Scala lately (Rust is getting into the mix slowly). And you should know, I am a heavy emacs user. I have been using emacs for close to 15 years, for the past 3 my emacs of choice has been spacemacs. I used to have a very long, customised and complex .emacs and with spacemacs I get a mostly-batteries-included package.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I’m a heavy &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/emacs&#34;&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt; user, and a frequent Scala developer. Scala tooling for emacs was restricted to mostly ensime until recently. Although ensime is an excellent piece of software, it made my old Macbook suffer a lot (it only had 8gb of RAM). So, most of the time I just went hardcore mode developer, and worked with no autocompletion, no jump to definition, no-nothing. A pervasive use of ripgrep and good memory were sometimes enough, but I was envious of many things I could see in my colleagues using IntelliJ. Of course, switching editors was not an option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Testing and debugging Apache Airflow We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Airflow for almost a year (on my suggestion). I&amp;rsquo;m not super-happy with it, and testing it is one of the pain points.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how you slip once on a habit and everything goes crazy? Well, I’ve been 4 weeks without writing these, so here’s the accumulated reading from 4 weeks. Because, even if I don’t write it, I read a lot anyway. Also, there’s lot of interesting content this “week”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you know me, you&amp;rsquo;ll know I have a quite extensive reading list. I keep it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of my to do stored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://culturedcode.com/things/&#34;&gt;Things3&lt;/a&gt;. It used to be &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; (hovering around 230 items since August) but during Christmas it got out of control, reaching almost 300 items.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I have been working a lot with a relatively large dataset on a Spark shell. It was a graph with 1 billion nodes and 2 billion edges that I wanted to analyse with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/graphframes/graphframes&#34;&gt;GraphFrames&lt;/a&gt; (the successor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.1/graphx-programming-guide.html&#34;&gt;GraphX&lt;/a&gt; on Spark).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coursier resolution failing with HTTP method 416 in sbt</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran into this problem with &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;/code&gt; dependency resolution around 7 weeks ago. I
was in a hurry, so I commented out the offending import (since it was not in the
subproject I was working on, so was not needed for the run I was in) sent my
commit to the heavens and &lt;a href=&#34;https://circleci.com/&#34;&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt; was happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Processing from Scala</title>
      <link>https://mostlymaths.net/2018/03/processing-and-scala.html/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 17:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mostlymaths.net/2018/03/processing-and-scala.html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had always wanted to play with Processing (after leafing through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Processing-Programming-Handbook-Designers-Artists/dp/026202828X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1520004355&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=processing+handbook&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;amp;linkId=08457cedf1bdf882589a65f2a56c181b&#34;&gt;The
Processing
Handbook&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Data-Explaining-Processing-Environment/dp/0596514557/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;amp;linkId=3aa08467e0b53ce75e261bf7a9d7cf3c&#34;&gt;Visualizing
Data&lt;/a&gt;
some years ago). My general dislike for Java or the JVM made me just play a
short amount of time with &lt;code&gt;processing.js&lt;/code&gt; something around 2011 (there was a
&lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; processing.js application for iOS, I used it for a while on my iPad and
iPod Touch).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ClassNotFoundException for Akka logging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I stumbled into the problem of Akka logging, specifically
ClassNotFoundException when using &lt;code&gt;akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLoggingFilter&lt;/code&gt;, just by
following the details of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/logging.html&#34;&gt;Logging - SL4J section of Akka
documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost two months ago (time sure flies) I attended for the second time the conference &lt;a href=&#34;https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8784-scala-exchange-2017&#34;&gt;Scala eXchange&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest Scala conferences in the world, and which happens to be 1 tube stop from the office you can find me from time to time in London.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shading dependencies with sbt-assembly (in particular, shapeless in Spark 2.1.0)</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago I needed to parse configuration files in Scala for a Spark project and decided to use PureConfig. It is incredibly lean to use, needing minimal boilerplate. I recommend you check it out (give also a look at CaseClassy, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to test yet).
Everything seemed straightforward enough, and I got it working pretty quickly (as in, it compiled properly). The surprise? spark-submit failed with a conflict with Shapeless (lacking a witness).</description>

At last February. Finished my PhD dissertation, so can add Dr. in front of my name when ordering a Gatwick Express train ticket. Also makes for a cooler email signature. So far has been the only differences I’ve seen in the year
Work February-December Started working as a consultant in London, almost the day after delivering the PhD presentation.</description>

      <title>October Kafka London Meetup - Jay Kreps: Distributed stream processing with Apache Kafka</title>
      <link>https://mostlymaths.net/2016/10/apache-kafka-london-meetup-distributed.html/</link>

      <description>This has been the first time I could attend the Apache Kafka meetup in London. Previous meetings had me in Barcelona or flying. First realisation: it is a surprisingly crowded meetup! Clearly, everyone is using Kafka, even if it is not clear from the outside. Oh, and the food was pretty good, too. Thanks to the sponsor (which I have sadly forgotten).
I really enjoyed this one. The speaker was Jay Kreps, CEO and co-founder of Confluent (and author of I Heart Logs), so, basically, a Kafka top committer himself.</description>

      <title>More emacs configuration tweaks (multiple-cursor on click, minimap, code folding, ensime eval overlays)</title>

      <description>At Affectv we use a wide range of editors: Sublime, Atom, Emacs, Pycharm, IntelliJ&amp;hellip; Actually only two people use the same editor! As such, from time to time I see things in other people&amp;rsquo;s editors that I would like to have as well. So, yesterday I decided to improve on some configuration settings on Spacemacs.
Click for multiple-cursors I saw this on Jordi&amp;rsquo;s Sublime, and it is much more comfortable than using more-like-this or similar helper functions, even if I need to use the trackpad to do so.</description>
