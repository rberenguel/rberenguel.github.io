Inspired by a post by Mark O&amp;rsquo;Connor from Yield Thought (my frequent readers will have already read something from him from my link collections), I have been working remotely for a week. His set-up is an iPad 2, Apple wireless keyboard, the iSSH app and an account in Linode.</description>

      <description>As of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot with data analysis and visualization tools. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read two interesting books (Statistical Analysis with Rand Visualize This: The FlowingData Guide to Design, Visualization, and Statistics) and I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to another two to refresh my statistics knowledge.
But this post is only mildly related to these books, since it started way before: the day I read about Gephi. Gephi is an open source graph visualization tool, to work with huge (or at least very big) datasets and graphs.</description>

      <description>From morguefile
It&amp;rsquo;s Friday afternoon after a long day and a long week. You board your train and are lucky to find a seat, soon it is crowded with people standing and chatting. You feel tired after the day, and think just about taking a late afternoon nap upon coming home.
But you plug your earphones, turn up the volume just until you can&amp;rsquo;t hear the train sounds and you are in another place.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been already a week since I started my emacs 30 day challenge, and it is time for an update on how it is going and what packages I am using. I&amp;rsquo;ll start giving configuration updates along the way, I&amp;rsquo;m still fiddling with them. You can check also my post about using gnus to read mail with Gmail.
Browsing with Conkeror The same day I started my 30 day challenge, the emacs focused blog emacs-fu posted a wonderful article highlighting the conkeror web browser (not to be confused with Konqueror, the standard browser in KDE based desktops).</description>

      <description>Hi readers! (woah&amp;hellip; 235 already! I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you&amp;rsquo;re here with me!)
This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Warsaw for a workshop (as I already commented in last post when I talked about the poster I am presenting).
I was expecting to use idle hours between talks and afternoons to write posts and post a little&amp;hellip; But my internet connection is inexistent. This post is coming from an open wifi connection, which gets connected and disconnected at random, and when at its peak, just makes 3Kb/s.</description>

Of course, I&amp;rsquo;d love if you bought any app through these links, but I have tried my best to make my review faithful. I don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to come later at me and say they were tricked into buying any app and the review was unfaithful to the application.</description>

      <title>Linux is a time killer</title>

      <description>Preface: I have been using Linux since around 1998, when I installed Debian from scratch in my old Pentium II. I am more end-user than power user, but the computer I use most often (my netbook) has Linux in it by default. Also, my office computer is a Linux computer. And I am writing this in my MacBook. Which is not Linux, but at least it is Unix. What comes now is a personal rant, after a fight with my netbook.</description>

      <description>While I was in Iceland, I started to see visits coming to my blog from www.hanselminutes.com&amp;hellip; A site I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about. As soon as I got a decent wifi coverage I went to see what it was about&amp;hellip; And it was a podcast!
From his own description,
 Hanselminutes is a weekly audio talk show with noted web developer and technologist Scott Hanselman and hosted by Carl Franklin. Scott discusses utilities and tools, gives practical how-to advice, and discusses ASP.</description>

      <description>Today I am leaving on holiday&amp;hellip; Destination: Iceland. It is funny, because we arranged everything (accomodation, car rental and such) just two weeks before Eyjafjallajökull started spitting ash. It have been a few months wondering whether we could make it to Iceland and come back&amp;hellip; Fortunately the little volcano took a pause and here we go.
I have a few scheduled posts for this few weeks (I&amp;rsquo;ll be back around 16th July) but I will be again posting more frequently after I am back.</description>

      <description>A week without writing here. A week with little thesis related work done. But it has also been a week with ideas and things and such. You know, two weeks ago I was in Dresden for a conference. Lots of parallel sessions, and quite a few time to think. This post is mostly a digest from my life bookmarks for these two weeks.
Several complex dynamic ideas: Unrelated to my thesis, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about them these days.</description>

      <description>My backlog of things happening is quickly filling, faster than I can even keep track of it. Just a quick overview
Summer trip to Iceland This summer we are going to Iceland for 17 days. It is some kind of tour-trip, where we have arranged accomodation and car rental and we just have to keep en route around the island to sleep where arranged each day. As an addition to this&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It had to happen sooner or later. This blog has been open, with a somewhat regular publication in English since March 2008, more or less a year ago. Before that, it was more sporadic, and used to be in Catalan, just to output some ideas or share a picture with a friend.
And the day had to come. To celebrate this approximate anniversary, I&amp;rsquo;m moving to my own domain and preparing a new look that will appear in about two weeks.</description>

      <description>After trying different methods to add &amp;ldquo;Digg this&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Stumble this!&amp;rdquo; and similar buttons, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that MyFolia&amp;rsquo;s approach is the best.

This neat bookmarks appear in the far bottom of every post, and allow to bookmark the current post in any of these websites (Digg, Reddit, del.icio.us, Facebook, technorati, Google and StumbleUpon). With autocompletion of the url and title, sure.
