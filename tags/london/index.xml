      <description>Almost two months ago (time sure flies) I attended for the second time the conference Scala eXchange, one of the largest Scala conferences in the world, and which happens to be 1 tube stop from the office you can find me from time to time in London. Also happens to be an excellent conference, and I’m repeating next year (yes, I already got my tickets).
For those who don’t know, Scala eXchange is a 2-day (plus an unconference day) conference in central London, bringing most of the library developers you love to talk about cool stuff.</description>

      <description>I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say we, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.
Work Everything work related has gone up. More work, better work, more interesting work.</description>

      <title>October Kafka London Meetup - Jay Kreps: Distributed stream processing with Apache Kafka</title>

      <description>This has been the first time I could attend the Apache Kafka meetup in London. Previous meetings had me in Barcelona or flying. First realisation: it is a surprisingly crowded meetup! Clearly, everyone is using Kafka, even if it is not clear from the outside. Oh, and the food was pretty good, too. Thanks to the sponsor (which I have sadly forgotten).
I really enjoyed this one. The speaker was Jay Kreps, CEO and co-founder of Confluent (and author of I Heart Logs), so, basically, a Kafka top committer himself.</description>
