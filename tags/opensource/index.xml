      <description>This week I have been working a lot with a relatively large dataset on a Spark shell. It was a graph with 1 billion nodes and 2 billion edges that I wanted to analyse with GraphFrames (the successor of GraphX on Spark). This is quite large: before running the graph algorithms I did some exploratory analysis, and each step took at least 10 minutes. Checking stage/task progress bars or generated analysis plans is only interesting for the first fee&amp;hellip; I wanted a way to get a subtle notification when the process finished.</description>

      <description>Or, how I made my first contribution to coursier
[trace] Stack trace suppressed: run last service/*:update for the full output. [error] (service/*:update) coursier.ResolutionException: 1 download error [error] Caught java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 416 for URL: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/graylog2/gelfj/1.1.14/gelfj-1.1.14.jar (Server returned HTTP response code: 416 for URL: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/graylog2/gelfj/1.1.14/gelfj-1.1.14.jar) while downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/graylog2/gelfj/1.1.14/gelfj-1.1.14.jar  I ran into this problem with sbt dependency resolution around 7 weeks ago. I was in a hurry, so I commented out the offending import (since it was not in the subproject I was working on, so was not needed for the run I was in) sent my commit to the heavens and CircleCI was happy.</description>
