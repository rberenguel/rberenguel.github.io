      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how you slip once on a habit and everything goes crazy? Well, I’ve been 4 weeks without writing these, so here’s the accumulated reading from 4 weeks.

      <description>A few months ago I stumbled into the problem of Akka logging, specifically ClassNotFoundException when using akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLoggingFilter, just by following the details of the Logging - SL4J section of Akka documentation. Of course, the error source is obvious in hindsight, but in the moment the fact that this was a multiproject build with several dependency paths made me miss a crucial reason for longer than I want to admit:
 YOU NEED TO ADD THE SL4J IMPORT IF YOU WANT TO USE SL4J FOR LOGGING!</description>
