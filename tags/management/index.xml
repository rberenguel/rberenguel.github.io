      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week is somewhat more eclectic than usual. There is nothing about any
particular programming language. There is a bit on Kubernetes, functional
programming and containers, project management, aviation history,
interviews/bios… I have started reading a few more papers, and I’ll share the
interesting ones as well. This week they are centered in data engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
