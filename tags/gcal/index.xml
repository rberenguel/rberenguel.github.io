      <description>Yes, you can! Adding colors to terminal output is possible. You already know it, from ls &amp;ndash;color In this post I show you a script that does it, in a simple way. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a full range of colors implemented, but you can find all here.

      <description>The Ben NanoNote has very few applications, as of now. And one it has (among a few nice others), is Gcal. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what Gcal was, and the Qi hardware wiki page on Gcal pointed me to this quite nice tutorial: The many uses of Gcal.
The tutorial is quite good, but somewhat long, and lacks a few specific examples, so I decided to write just what I read in that tutorial, mixed with the uses I am putting it to, so it is more a Gcal use cases than a full blown tutorial like that.</description>
