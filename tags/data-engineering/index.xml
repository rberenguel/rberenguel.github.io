      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week there is a lot of functional programming (mostly Scala, a bit of
Haskell) and data engineering topics. Of course, there is also the usual random
stuff I find interesting as well (and other engineering topics).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mixed bag of interesting history tidbits sprinkled with Haskell code, Scala
stuff, data engineering systems and practices, and how to code with your voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This feels like a heavy engineering edition. A lot of Haskell, Rust, Python and
Scala. There’s still a bit of everything, but this will appeal hardcore
developers more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a slightly longer edition because my reading list was overflowing with
400+ articles. I “trimmed” it down to “only” 380 during this week, I had a lot
of airport time due to going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spark Summit
Europe&lt;/a&gt; to give a talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some data engineering, a bit of Haskell, programming music, Python and random
bits and bobs. I recommend you play with the third. Several good books this
week, as I have ramped up my reading: current goal would be 52 this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
