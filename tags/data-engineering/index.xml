      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working on several personal projects lately. Basically scratching
projects itching on my to do lists for several months. This is the first write
up from them: templating without base repositories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No specific theme this week, but feels more data engineering heavy than lately. As it should. Oh, and beware door knobs, they can bring evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Skipped last week &lt;code&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt; This week has more machine learning than usual for no special reason. Posting this at 4 AM because for some reason I could not sleep and decided I may as well finish this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First edition of the New Year. As eclectic as usual, I hope. The audio-based monitoring of servers and the weird uses of the GPT-2 neural network could be two highlights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On time this week. Nothing remarkable: I&amp;rsquo;m winding down a bit my reading (both articles and books) in preparation for the yearly review and having some cooldown period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A flight last Sunday meant I was so sleepy I skipped sending last week&amp;rsquo;s newsletter… so this week is super-sized. A lot of content about distributed teams I think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week is somewhat more eclectic than usual. There is nothing about any
particular programming language. There is a bit on Kubernetes, functional
programming and containers, project management, aviation history,
interviews/bios… I have started reading a few more papers, and I’ll share the
interesting ones as well. This week they are centered in data engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I skipped last week. On Saturday &lt;a href=&#34;http://pybcn.org&#34;&gt;Python Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;
organised &lt;a href=&#34;https://pybcn.org/pyday-bcn-2019/&#34;&gt;PyDay 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and I was one of the
organisers aside from giving &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/pyspark_workshop&#34;&gt;a workshop on
PySpark&lt;/a&gt;, so I felt pretty tired
on Sunday. Of course this means this is a double issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week there is a lot of functional programming (mostly Scala, a bit of
Haskell) and data engineering topics. Of course, there is also the usual random
stuff I find interesting as well (and other engineering topics).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mixed bag of interesting history tidbits sprinkled with Haskell code, Scala
stuff, data engineering systems and practices, and how to code with your voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This feels like a heavy engineering edition. A lot of Haskell, Rust, Python and
Scala. There’s still a bit of everything, but this will appeal hardcore
developers more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a slightly longer edition because my reading list was overflowing with
400+ articles. I “trimmed” it down to “only” 380 during this week, I had a lot
of airport time due to going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe&#34;&gt;Spark Summit
Europe&lt;/a&gt; to give a talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some data engineering, a bit of Haskell, programming music, Python and random
bits and bobs. I recommend you play with the third. Several good books this
week, as I have ramped up my reading: current goal would be 52 this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
