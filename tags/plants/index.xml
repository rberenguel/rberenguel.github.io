      <description>Just a quick update about my tiny strawberries. A lot more have germinated, and now the first one to do so are showing their first true, small and beautiful leaves. I also added some more soil and add a few drops of water with a little fertilizer (from what I gave my other plants).
 
If you enjoyed this post, or was lucky and got a nice and happy strawberry plant, leave a comment or picture.</description>

If you want to grow your own lemon tree, come join the Lemon tree give-away!
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll teach you the procedure I followed to easily germinate apple seeds at home. You can also try apple seed germination, pineapple seed germination, [](http://plants.mostlymaths.net/2010/07/tomato-seed-germination.html)[tomato seed germination](http://plants.mostlymaths.net/2010/07/tomato-seed-germination.html), cotton seed germination, finally lemon seed germination and now ginger germination. More to come next spring!
Four steps to go.
