      <description>Almost two months ago (time sure flies) I attended for the second time the conference Scala eXchange, one of the largest Scala conferences in the world, and which happens to be 1 tube stop from the office you can find me from time to time in London. Also happens to be an excellent conference, and I’m repeating next year (yes, I already got my tickets).
For those who don’t know, Scala eXchange is a 2-day (plus an unconference day) conference in central London, bringing most of the library developers you love to talk about cool stuff.</description>
