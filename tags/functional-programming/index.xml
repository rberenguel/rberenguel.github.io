      <description>I have been on quite the hiatus, making this more of a readings of the month edition. Last one was published/sent a bit more than a month ago (and my reading list is now at 347 pending), but there is a reason. The reason has been a mix of other side stuff taking over and a big project related to my blog: I have moved (after something like 14 years) from Blogger.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been pretty busy lately, and although reading doesn’t stop, my writing sometimes takes a hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data engineering, adtech, history, apple. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tag here&lt;/a&gt; . You can also get these as a weekly newsletter by subscribing &lt;a href=&#34;http://eepurl.com/geFw7P&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A (section) of a map of the data engineering space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The map and problem described here were part of my presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mapping as a tool for thought&lt;/a&gt;, and mentioned in my interview with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jhngrant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;John Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BenMosior&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ben Mosior&lt;/a&gt; (to appear sometime soon in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9-K9BLFozmmvmWzjyjkow&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps community youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;). I’m looking for ideas on how to make this map easier to understand and useful, so I posted it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.wardleymaps.com/t/rfc-a-section-of-a-map-of-the-data-engineering-space/452&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps Community forums requesting comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
