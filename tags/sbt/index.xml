      <description>This week I have been working a lot with a relatively large dataset on a Spark shell. It was a graph with 1 billion nodes and 2 billion edges that I wanted to analyse with GraphFrames (the successor of GraphX on Spark). This is quite large: before running the graph algorithms I did some exploratory analysis, and each step took at least 10 minutes. Checking stage/task progress bars or generated analysis plans is only interesting for the first fee&amp;hellip; I wanted a way to get a subtle notification when the process finished.</description>
