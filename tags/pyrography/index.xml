      <description>Santa brought me the gift I wanted for Christmas: a pyrograph. In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, a pyrograph is a tool to draw over wood, by burning it.
As you may already know, I love drawing (in particular, ink drawing). This is similar: you don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of control over tone and a mistake can ruin the drawing.
This was the first time I used one, and to test how it worked I decided to draw a Celtic knot over a wooden box.</description>
