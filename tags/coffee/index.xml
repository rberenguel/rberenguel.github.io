      <description>Thermometers are already hitting 29°C with temperature feelings around 32 or 33. It’s this time of the year when I need cold drinks to keep me alive. I’m not a big soda fan (except when I’m on Finland in the Nordic Go Academy camp, they are so stocked on soda that I’m dragged in,) so my go-to drink is usually freshly squeezed lemonade with some ice cubes and sometimes a pinch of soda to make it fizz (and make it less acid.</description>

 125 gr butter 110 gr sugar (+ 1 big spoon later) 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or change some sugar for vanillated sugar) 250 gr flour 1&amp;frasl;2 teaspoon nutmeg 3&amp;frasl;4 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon cinnamon</description>

They told me it is good with milk and also alone, and indeed it is.</description>
