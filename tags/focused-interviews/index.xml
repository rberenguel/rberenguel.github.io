      <description>This is Steven!
I guess there is not much need of an introduction for Steven. Just in case, Steven Pressfield is a best-selling author who started its career with The Legend of Bagger Vance and then started to write historical fiction, usually military themed. Some of his books (like Gates of Fire and Tides of War) have achieved cult status among military people, and they are even used as teaching material in some military schools.</description>
