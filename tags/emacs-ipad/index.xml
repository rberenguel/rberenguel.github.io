A few months ago I wrote about how I&amp;rsquo;m using vim in my ipad. You know, I&amp;rsquo;m an emacs guy, just started writing my own (useful) stuff to improve it. Recently I finished gnusnotes.el, a package which allows you to easily add notes to emails. Of course, before this I had already written emacs code, just that it was only for me.</description>

      <description>Just in case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, vi is an advanced text editor, drting back from the same era as emacs was developed (emacs started slightly earlier). Sort of the Jekyll to emacs&amp;rsquo; Dr Hyde. Emacs users despise vi users, and vi users mock emacs users. This is what the editor wars are all about: &amp;ldquo;Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;vi has two modes: writing and beeping&amp;rdquo;. If you have been long enough in this blog, you know I&amp;rsquo;m in the emacs side, but you also know I&amp;rsquo;m curious enough to delve into the other side.</description>
