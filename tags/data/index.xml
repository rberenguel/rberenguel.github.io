      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been pretty busy lately, and although reading doesn’t stop, my writing sometimes takes a hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data engineering, adtech, history, apple. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tag here&lt;/a&gt; . You can also get these as a weekly newsletter by subscribing &lt;a href=&#34;http://eepurl.com/geFw7P&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A (section) of a map of the data engineering space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The map and problem described here were part of my presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mapping as a tool for thought&lt;/a&gt;, and mentioned in my interview with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jhngrant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;John Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BenMosior&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ben Mosior&lt;/a&gt; (to appear sometime soon in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9-K9BLFozmmvmWzjyjkow&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps community youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;). I’m looking for ideas on how to make this map easier to understand and useful, so I posted it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.wardleymaps.com/t/rfc-a-section-of-a-map-of-the-data-engineering-space/452&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps Community forums requesting comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week is a bit light on technical content because I was attending &lt;a href=&#34;https://scaladays.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scala Days 2019&lt;/a&gt; in Lausanne and I had enough with the talks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how you slip once on a habit and everything goes crazy? Well, I’ve been 4 weeks without writing these, so here’s the accumulated reading from 4 weeks. Because, even if I don’t write it, I read a lot anyway. Also, there’s lot of interesting content this “week”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I installed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apache/hive&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hive&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; on my Mac. Sadly, when I tried to run the &lt;code&gt;hive&lt;/code&gt; command, I got the weird-looking error&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you know me, you&amp;rsquo;ll know I have a quite extensive reading list. I keep it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of my to do stored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://culturedcode.com/things/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Things3&lt;/a&gt;. It used to be &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; (hovering around 230 items since August) but during Christmas it got out of control, reaching almost 300 items.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Some of the links are affiliate links to Amazon. I only recommend what I use.
At last February. Finished my PhD dissertation, so can add Dr. in front of my name when ordering a Gatwick Express train ticket. Also makes for a cooler email signature. So far has been the only differences I’ve seen in the year
Work February-December Started working as a consultant in London, almost the day after delivering the PhD presentation.</description>

      <description>Started a long time ago. It was supposed to be about a phenomenon leading to chaos: separatrix splitting. I got a research grant. I worked on holomorphic dynamics. Travelled. Presented. Too many roadblocks with the separatrix problem. Switched topics. Welcome to a different new world, infinite dimensional dynamical systems. I read the literature. Researched, proved some things. My grant ran out. I worked. A lot. Too many times I considered giving up.</description>

Beware! The software described here is just for personal and very light use. Its use beyond purely recreational value is against Google Search terms of service, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want you or anyone to step that line. Any use of this code is at your own risk.
Well, after this scary paragraph, lets get to the real meat. Which boils down to just a few lines of bash.</description>

      <description>As of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot with data analysis and visualization tools. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read two interesting books (Statistical Analysis with R and Visualize This: The FlowingData Guide to Design, Visualization, and Statistics and I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to another two to refresh my statistics knowledge.
But this post is only mildly related to these books, since it started way before: the day I read about Gephi. Gephi is an open source graph visualization tool, to work with huge (or at least big) datasets and graphs.</description>
