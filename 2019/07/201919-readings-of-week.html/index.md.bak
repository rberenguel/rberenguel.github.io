[When Pepsi Had a Navy](https://lflank.wordpress.com/2019/06/25/when-pepsi-had-a-navy/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the title, I thought it was related to the ‚ÄúSugar Wars‚Äù, but the reality is weirder.

[Your Work Peak Is Earlier Than You Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/work-peak-professional-decline/590650/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mildly depressing. A quote I found interesting:

> Careers that rely primarily on fluid intelligence tend to peak early, while those that use more crystallized intelligence peak later. For example, Dean Keith Simonton has found that poets‚Äîhighly fluid in their creativity‚Äîtend to have produced half their lifetime creative output by age 40 or so. Historians‚Äîwho rely on a crystallized stock of knowledge‚Äîdon‚Äôt reach this milestone until about 60.

[Why I (as of June 22 2019) think Haskell is the best general purpose language (as of June 22 2019)](http://www.philipzucker.com/why-i-as-of-june-22-2019-think-haskell-is-the-best-general-purpose-language-as-of-june-22-2019/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although I can somewhat read Haskell code, I still can‚Äôt write much. So, can‚Äôt really agree... Yet.

[Easy Parsing with Parser Combinators](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/EasyParsingwithParserCombinators.html)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a small project I wrote with AWK that I want to rewrite ‚Äúproperly‚Äù in Scala, and I‚Äôd need to do some real parsing (not the ad-hoc parsing you always end up writing in AWK), so learning to use FastParse is worth it. Also Li is a very clear writer.

[Sam and Max Hit the Road Development History](https://www.filfre.net/2019/06/sam-and-max-hit-the-road/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So many fond memories from this game, I‚Äôm getting it again from GOG any day soon. Also this post made me look up where my copy of the ??? was.

[Comonads for Life](http://justinhj.github.io/2019/06/20/comonads-for-life.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementing the Game of Life using comonads (the dual of monads)

[Real-world dynamic programming: seam carving](https://avikdas.com/2019/05/14/real-world-dynamic-programming-seam-carving.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have always been fascinated by seam carving. It‚Äôs so amazing

[The surprising story of the Basque language](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190603-the-surprising-story-of-the-basque-language)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uhm, Armenia is not even close.

[History Will Not Be Kind to Jony Ive](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywyjmw/history-will-not-be-kind-to-jony-ive)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flexgate, antennagate, keyboardgate. There have been many f-ups that can be traced back to looking for a specific design. I hope Apple gets back to top-design and top-usability now.

['It's getting warmer, wetter, wilder': the Arctic town heating faster than anywhere](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/01/its-getting-warmer-wetter-wilder-the-arctic-town-heating-faster-than-anywhere)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Longyearbyen (Svalbard‚Äôs capital) is in danger.

[Reasons of State: Why Didn't Denmark Sell Greenland?](https://www.gwern.net/Greenland)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An analysis by Gwern Branwen about why Denmark didn‚Äôt sell Greenland to the US after WWII (they wanted it as a base).

['Like a military operation': restoration of Rembrandt's Night Watch begins](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/05/restoration-rembrandt-night-watch-begins-rijksmuseum-amsterdam)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The weight of the painting will surprise you.

üìö [Sprint](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/B019R2DQIY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=sprint&qid=1562614783&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=fb18e74156fff4db8a1ff8a2be2ffd9a)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The nitty gritty details of how to run design sprints (a Google practice). Interesting.

üìö [Diaspora](https://www.amazon.com/Diaspora/dp/B00GMOI58M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1562614527&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=c9fab66ed1bf8507d7970fe8282c09cc)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second Egan book I read (after [Clockwork Rocket](https://www.amazon.com/The-Clockwork-Rocket/dp/B00GMOI3SO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=clockwork+rocket&qid=1562614697&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=6d7c8ec8f282ef75034266c00a320ded)) and I found Diaspora much better, although with a weak ending and a somewhat erratic plot. The book has some strong [Star maker](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Maker/dp/B0098OIMWC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1562614660&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=cc5daf485e65c72573c57260ecab14e6) vibes. By the way, when adding the link above I thought the narrator for Audible was [this Adam Epstein](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/adam_epstein/) (a pretty darn good mathematician I know)

üìö [Thinking in bets](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions-ebook/dp/B074DG9LQF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=ac12d803e70aa3b70df18c1794b0be13)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The general idea is sound, but it‚Äôs one of those books that could be written as a long blog post or short essay.

üìö [Set your voice free](https://www.amazon.com/Set-Your-Voice-Free-Speaking/dp/B01MRSDFSG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=set+your+voice+free&qid=1562614842&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=79e9518d0ce239c93bef6f65564e9967)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercises to improve your voice. I have recently started to do the daily warm-ups, but so far have felt no difference. Of course, other people should be the ones to tell me.

üé• [Wardley mapping interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz5SHJ4Fyag)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was recently interviewed by [John Grant](https://twitter.com/jhngrant) and [Ben Mosior](https://twitter.com/BenMosior) as part of a set of interviews leading up to [MapCamp London 2019](https://www.map-camp.com/_pages/2019-10-15_London/). If you are interested in my thoughts about mapping the tech landscape, I [wrote my train of thought in this blog post as well](https://www.mostlymaths.net/2019/07/a-section-of-map-of-data-engineering.html).
