I have been pretty busy lately, and although reading doesn‚Äôt stop, my writing sometimes takes a hiatus.

Data engineering, adtech, history, apple. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag here](https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek) .

[The Launch](https://story.californiasunday.com/cosmic-crisp-apple-launch)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

And it‚Äôs not about a technology product.  

[How I practice at what I do](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/how-i-practice-at-what-i-do.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Good Employee, a story about how you can explain modern companies with graph theory](https://madeddu.xyz/posts/im-still-learning/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was a weird read. But now I wonder if I can use Prim‚Äôs algorithm to improve my decision making?  

[The Washington Post is preparing for post-cookie ad targeting](https://digiday.com/media/were-building-for-media-businesses-of-tomorrow-how-the-washington-post-is-preparing-for-a-cookieless-future/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cookiepocalypse is coming, and if you work in adtech you should be thinking about it.  

[Dry Stone Walls ‚Äì Principles of structurally sound construction](https://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2018/11/01/dry-stone-walls-principles-of-structurally-sound-construction/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Around my hometown (L‚ÄôArbo√ß) there‚Äôs an abundance of dry stone wall huts, presumedly from around 18th century. Now I know how to build one.  

[Book Review: Impro by Keith Johnstone](http://theoryengine.org/mental-health/book-review-impro-by-keith-johnstone/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may be aware that I read anything that can improve me in any way. So, [Impro](https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1564331328&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=f04863639a6d8fd13d8e8f242d062b36) is now on my currently reading.  

[Introducing Dagster](https://medium.com/@schrockn/introducing-dagster-dbd28442b2b7)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anything that is _not_ Airflow is a win on my book, but I‚Äôm not super-thrilled about how Dagster works either.  

[Here Dragons Abound: Iskloft Mountain Style](https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2019/04/iskloft-mountain-style.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have always loved maps and map-drawing, so how to draw fantasy maps is an interesting enough subject on its own.  

[Why Category Theory Matters](http://rs.io/why-category-theory-matters/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm ramping up my category theory knowledge lately (and spreading through to sheaves and maybe schemes).  

[Roger Federer as Religious Experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html)

We‚Äôll miss him (and Rafa Nadal, and Novak Djokovic) when he retires.  

[Did Functional Programming get it wrong? - Noteworthy](https://blog.usejournal.com/monoids-to-groupoids-492c35105113)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôve been thinking about ‚Äúspreadsheets‚Äù as in ‚Äúdata and code mixed‚Äù lately, specially in terms of category theory, so this post was... close to mind-reading.  

[If you‚Äôre playing EVE online you basically already have an MBA](https://kotaku.com/if-you-re-playing-eve-online-you-basically-already-have-1835048929)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôve never been drawn to that game, but given the amount of hours some people give it, it makes total sense.  

[Haskell - An Experience Summary](https://holmusk.dev/blog/2019-03-29-experience-summary.html)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of my categorification, I‚Äôm back again at learning Haskell (using [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)). So I‚Äôm reading anything reasonably non-technical about Haskell.  

['These kids are ticking time bombs' -- The threat of youth basketball](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27125793/these-kids-ticking-bombs-threat-youth-basketball)

The amount of bone and tissue stress a young basketball player has gone through is astonishing.  

[‚ÄòI don‚Äôt see jeans in my future‚Äô: the people who wear complete historical dress ‚Äì every day](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jul/04/i-dont-see-jeans-in-my-future-the-people-who-wear-complete-historical-dress-every-day)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like that 30s look. I even have a similar hat.  

[Preserving Laptop Stickers on MacBooks - Graham Stevens](https://grh.am/2019/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seems too late for my batch of stickers, but I always pick 2 of a kind if possible, now I‚Äôm thinking where should I show the duplicates.  

[For 40 Years, Crashing Trains Was One of America‚Äôs Favourite Pastimes](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/staged-train-wrecks)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Watching things explode has always been fun?  

[Pearls Before Breakfast](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721_pf.html??noredirect=on)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôve seen many people recommend this book... And I didn‚Äôt get it. It was interesting, but not so much as I expected.  

[üé• Approaching the Yoneda Lemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWFI4aN4h0Q)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some ways of seeing the Yoneda lemma. I‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head categorically, without forgetting anything. I want to be free.
