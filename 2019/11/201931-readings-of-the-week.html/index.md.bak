This week there is a lot of functional programming (mostly Scala, a bit of
Haskell) and data engineering topics. Of course, there is also the usual random
stuff I find interesting as well (and other engineering topics).

**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links. A large amount of data engineering and functional programming this time (mostly Scala, bits of Haskell), usual random stuff as well, don‚Äôt worry. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag here](https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek).

## [SkillsMatter gone](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/skills-matter-appointed-administrators-wendy-devolder/)

This week SkillsMatter in London has gone into administration, making one of the
best organizations for conferences go bust. Also, a large amount of conference
videos hosted in their Vimeo account (including my [lightning TLA+
talk](https://github.com/rberenguel/tla_lightning) from last year‚Äôs Scala
Exchange) are in limbo. They'll be missed.

## [Comparing Database Types: How Database Types Evolved to Meet Different Needs](https://www.prisma.io/blog/comparison-of-database-models-1iz9u29nwn37)
Timeline of different models of data storage and retrieval for databases. 

## [Final Tagless](https://www.zjuwyd.com/2018/12/16/ep/)
An explanation of the Final Tagless approach to composition, with code examples in (readable) Haskell.

## [Project Silica proof of concept stores Warner Bros. ‚ÄòSuperman‚Äô movie on quartz glass](https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/ignite-project-silica-superman/)
For cold storage. Joke about the Fortress of Solitude incoming.

## [Trajectory recovery from Ash: User privacy is NOT preserved in aggregated mobility data](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/05/15/trajectory-recovery-from-ash-user-privacy-is-not-preserved-in-aggregated-mobility-data/)
It‚Äôs such a WAAAT. I want to implement this, the paper is on my reading list. TL;DR: you can pinpoint individual trajectories out of aggregated data with a _huge_ confidence.

## [Por que Parquet](https://medium.com/when-i-work-data/por-que-parquet-2a3ec42141c6)
Impact of switching to Parquet in network usage vs JSON. It may sound an obvious change, but it can be far from one.

## [Opinion | 5-Hour Workdays? 4-Day Workweeks? Yes, Please](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/opinion/five-hour-workday-experiment.html)
Opinion piece by [Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=cal+newport&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&linkCode=ll2&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=7b241f0f0c23890562872cdb0a840666&language=en_US), riding the wave of the recent [Microsoft Japan 4 day workweek experiment](https://soranews24.com/2019/11/03/microsoft-japans-experiment-with-3-day-weekend-boosts-worker-productivity-by-40-percent/). If we talk about pure output, 5 hours of intensive, output focused time (no distractions) would be close to a perfect day for anybody, in my own tracking I have rarely hit more than 6 hours. Eventually the rest of the work day fills with coordination, chatter, meetings, etc.

## [Halide 1.14 adds full iPhone 11 support, a 'Tactile Lens Switcher,' 'Lens Guides' and more](https://www.dpreview.com/news/5774395116/halide-1-14-adds-full-iphone-11-support-a-tactile-lens-switcher-lens-guides-and-more)
I got an iPhone 11 Pro last Monday. The camera is _wow_. And the battery life is _waaat_. I‚Äôve had it last 2 days, with normal use (reading a couple of hours, browsing, mail handling, Slack..). Halide is one of the best photography apps for iOS and I‚Äôm eager to go get some nice shots with it.

## [Who is the real Dice Man? The elusive writer behind the disturbing cult novel](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/nov/07/the-dice-man-elusive-author-luke-rhinehart-george-cockroft-emmanuel-carrere)
The hunt for Luke Rhinehart, author/subject of [The Dice Man](https://www.amazon.com/Dice-Man-Luke-Rhinehart/dp/0879518642/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=the+dice+man&qid=1573332095&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=636268d4e5a4b38724faef3cbbf07a16&language=en_US).

## [Composing Spark data pipelines](http://www.stephenzoio.com/creating-composable-data-pipelines-spark/)
Using monads to compose Spark operations. Bring more FP to your data life. 

## [The Spark Job pattern](https://medium.com/albert-franzi/the-spark-job-pattern-862bc518632a)
Similar to the previous (but done earlier, and [presented in a Spark Summit](https://databricks.com/speaker/albert-franzi-cros)), in case you don‚Äôt like the full FP kool-aid.

## [Leaked document reveals..](https://boingboing.net/2019/10/30/citizen-scores-eh.html)
> ..that Sidewalk Labs' Toronto plans for private taxation, private roads, charter schools, corporate cops and judges, and punishment for people who choose privacy

This was a long article title. But this is _Black Mirror_ level.

## [Error Handling in Functional Applications - from Monad Transformers to ZIO](http://lambdaone.io/2019/09/06/zio-errors/)
A brief tour through what‚Äôs mentioned in the title. The example code is really clean and worth a look.

## [Depth of Field](https://inconvergent.net/2019/depth-of-field/)
I love generative art concepts, and this DOF method to display graphs is beautiful.

## [DataOps Principles: How Startups Do Data The Right Way](https://retina.ai/blog/dataops-principles/)
(Supposed) principles for a proper data operation team. Take the ones you like (some, like the manual-manual-automate one are gold). Ignore the ones you don‚Äôt.

## [New In PostgreSQL 12: Generated Columns](https://pgdash.io/blog/postgres-12-generated-columns.html)
Remember, paraphrasing a classic mantra from the previous century: _nobody was fired for choosing PostgreSQL_. In case of doubt, pgsql it. Generated columns can be thought of as cheaper trigger computations.

## [The Trade of the Century: When George Soros Broke the British Pound](https://priceonomics.com/the-trade-of-the-century-when-george-soros-broke/)
How hedging works, with the UK as a sad background.

## [The Lost Key of QWERTY](http://widespacer.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-lost-key-of-qwerty.html)
The first keyboards had a key we no longer have. The answer will‚Ä¶ not sure. I found it interesting as a history piece.

## [Mathematicians Cut Apart Shapes to Find Pieces of Equations](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-cut-apart-shapes-to-find-pieces-of-equations-20191031/)
The invariant described here seems super deep. I‚Äôm eager to learn more about how this develops.

## [We built network isolation for 1,500 services to make Monzo more secure](https://monzo.com/blog/we-built-network-isolation-for-1-500-services)
The idea of a monorepo housing 1500 microservices makes me shudder. Although, haven‚Äôt tried, maybe it‚Äôs an excellent idea in some case.

## üçø [Finding bugs without running or even looking at code by Jay Parlar](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FvNRlE4E9QQ)
This is a similar talk to the one I shared a couple of weeks ago by Jay as well, but more easily digestible if you don‚Äôt know TLA+. Super recommended!

## üîä [Getting Thing Done: the art of stress free productivity](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/B01B6WSK5C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=getting+things+done&qid=1573332361&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=2113b1fe90971bd566b89c2c04e6c06e&language=en_US)
My classic yearly re-read (re-listen in this case) of GTD. If you could get hold of Allen‚Äôs [Getting Things Done Fast](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Fast-Productivity/dp/B000JZ7PMW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=28c4f99fc8616511aee6e7d512ca3dec&language=en_US) audio instead, it is much more fun (but you better have a grasp of the system beforehand, the material is not as clear-cut as in the book/audiobook).

## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters I‚Äôm subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).
