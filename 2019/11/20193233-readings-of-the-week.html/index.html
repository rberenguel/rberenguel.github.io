</figure>


<p>In case you are curious, these two weeks I read 98 articles (not counting the
news or recipes) from my reading list (as usual, not everything happened
recently, I read each article when I see fit). Of these, I found around 40
interesting or unusual enough to make it here (there is a mild preselection
bias: I’m more likely to read an interesting one than an uninteresting one).</p>

<p>I get asked on occasion how I manage to read so much (since I also read several
books during the year). It is basically a combination of mild multitasking (I
read while watching TV after dinner) and long commute time (when I need to go to
the city it takes me more than 1 hour). So, I try to squeeze one reading list
item if the time is short, and may read from a book if the time is longer. Also,
while doing household chores I’m either on Audible or a podcast.</p>

<p>The picture above is of my new keyboard, a
<a href="https://www.gboards.ca/product/gergo" target="_blank">Gergo</a>. I went full split, with
<a href="https://qmk.fm" target="_blank">QMK</a>: I think once you have a QMK powered keyboard there is no
way back now. I&rsquo;ll be writing a blog post about my setup of it and what I&rsquo;m
liking &ldquo;soon&rdquo;. If there are typos in. today&rsquo;s post, blame my acclimating to
lower action keys.</p>

<p>I can work in super-noisy environments just fine, as long as it’s close to white
noise. I.e. a busy coffee place is ok, because there will be enough noise to
avoid triggers. But an open office with one sales guy screaming “hey I good work
dude” to another (been there) irks me tremendously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why microcode? One of the hardest parts of computer design is creating the
control logic that tells each part of the processor what to do to carry out
each instruction. In 1951, Maurice Wilkes came up with the idea of microcode:
instead of building the control logic from complex logic gate circuitry, the
control logic could be replaced with code (i.e. microcode) stored in a special
memory called a control store. To execute an instruction, the computer
internally executes several simpler micro-instructions, which are specified by
the microcode. With microcode, building the processor&rsquo;s control logic becomes
a programming task instead of a logic design task.</p>

<p>A low level example of using ZIO, to get to know its underlying principles.
Don&rsquo;t assume this is <em>like</em> Kafka!</p>

<p>TL;DR (because the title is not that clear either) is to use
<a href="https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/swifter" target="_blank">swifter</a>, a library that dynamically
chooses Pandas methods or Dask methods to be as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>The Sweet Setup has always interesting articles on iOS and Mac apps. This time
they tried their hand at tiling window managers for Mac. I used some in the past
myself (<a href="https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst" target="_blank">Amethyst</a> and kwm, the predecesor of
<a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm" target="_blank">chunkwm</a>). Nowadays I use
<a href="https://github.com/kasper/phoenix" target="_blank">Phoenix</a> with custom-written commands to
split windows in certain ways.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m slightly dubious of the result (reading should be as fast in both).</p>

<p>The book I mention on the first article. It was deeply touching, realising &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not the only one&rdquo; with this kind of thirst for different things. It was also
revealing in how to approach multiple passions and hobbies, and what to do to
take full advantage of this. Read it, ASAP. Especially if you like the eclectic
selection of topics I offer.</p>

<p>Very interesting, with a surprising amount of mentions of familiar
mathematicians. It&rsquo;s more of a biography of Renaissance, more than Simons, but
it&rsquo;s interesting nonetheless.</p>
