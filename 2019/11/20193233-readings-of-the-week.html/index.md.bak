Yeah, I skipped last week. On Saturday [Python Barcelona](http://pybcn.org)
organised [PyDay 2019](https://pybcn.org/pyday-bcn-2019/), and I was one of the
organisers aside from giving [a workshop on
PySpark](https://github.com/rberenguel/pyspark_workshop), so I felt pretty tired
on Sunday. Of course this means this is a double issue.

{{< figure src="gergo.jpg" class="fig-wide" caption="My new keyboard">}}

In case you are curious, these two weeks I read 98 articles (not counting the
news or recipes) from my reading list (as usual, not everything happened
recently, I read each article when I see fit). Of these, I found around 40
interesting or unusual enough to make it here (there is a mild preselection
bias: I’m more likely to read an interesting one than an uninteresting one).

I get asked on occasion how I manage to read so much (since I also read several
books during the year). It is basically a combination of mild multitasking (I
read while watching TV after dinner) and long commute time (when I need to go to
the city it takes me more than 1 hour). So, I try to squeeze one reading list
item if the time is short, and may read from a book if the time is longer. Also,
while doing household chores I’m either on Audible or a podcast.

The picture above is of my new keyboard, a
[Gergo](https://www.gboards.ca/product/gergo). I went full split, with
[QMK](https://qmk.fm): I think once you have a QMK powered keyboard there is no
way back now. I'll be writing a blog post about my setup of it and what I'm
liking "soon". If there are typos in. today's post, blame my acclimating to
lower action keys.

**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links.
Haskell, history, psychology, data Expect a similar wide range in the future as
well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag

## [On being a “scanner” personality](https://medium.com/@sebastianmartin2044/on-being-a-scanner-personality-9cfb4129c5d)
If you only read one article from this edition, read this. You may find out
something about you. I also read the book mentioned (see bottom) and it's
definitely recommended.

## [Pykka 2.0 released with better ergonomics and performance improvements](https://jodal.no/2019/05/07/pykka-2.0/)
This is not news: happened almost 7 months ago, but is worth knowing that Python
_does_ have an actor implementation, and that is Pykka.

## [The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius](http://paulgraham.com/genius.html)
There are some vibes in this Paul Graham essay that link to the _Scanner
personality_ article above.

## [Setting up a Haskell environment](https://www.47deg.com/blog/setting-up-haskell/)
I had to do this a few weeks ago and was not a nice experience. This is the
streamlined version of the roundabout way I did it.

## [Go’s features of last resort](https://www.arp242.net/go-last-resort.html)
This is an interesting list.

## [A dead-simple web stack in Haskell](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-16-a-dead-simple-web-stack.html)
I keep thinking I'll like Haskell, and reality always makes me rethink. Anyway,
this is a list of "boring" Haskell libraries to write a web service.

## [Brokering Bricks: The World of Lego Investing](https://medium.com/wisecrack/brokering-bricks-the-world-of-lego-investing-66d1a59fc206)
Anything scarce will be traded.

## [Day of the Tentacle (The Digital Antiquarian)](https://www.filfre.net/2019/06/day-of-the-tentacle/) 
Not the first or second article by the Digital Antiquarian I share.

## [Boring Haskell Manifesto](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2019/11/boring-haskell-manifesto)
I feel attracted to writing Haskell, and put off by many things. The ideas
herein could help.

## [Introducing ksqlDB](https://www.confluent.io/blog/intro-to-ksqldb-sql-database-streaming)
> It does not provide read-after-write consistency, and isn’t intended as an
> OLTP store for primary data.

I like Kafka a lot, but always beware of its kool-aid. The quote above comes
from the article itself. Define DB at your own risk.

## [Physicists Claim They've Found Even More Evidence of a New Force of Nature](https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-claim-a-they-ve-found-even-more-evidence-of-a-new-force-of-nature)
Super interesting to read, although the missing piece is knowing _what_ this
force does. As in, it has been observed to _affect_ certain decays, but is that
what it controls? [This
article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/dark-matter-particle-hungary-atomki-nuclear-research-force-nature-a9210741.html)
from The Independent is a bit better than the above though.

## [Blade Runner | Typeset In The Future](https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/06/19/bladerunner/)
This is a very old article on the typography of Blade Runner (a personal
favourite), but the events in Blade Runner happened recently, so...

## [How Turkish coffee destroyed an empire](https://www.1843magazine.com/food-drink/world-in-a-dish/how-turkish-coffee-destroyed-an-empire)
Always consider first, second, third order effects, especially if your timespan
is long.

## [Why office noise bothers some people more than others](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20191115-office-noise-acceptable-levels-personality-type)
I can work in super-noisy environments just fine, as long as it’s close to white
noise. I.e. a busy coffee place is ok, because there will be enough noise to
avoid triggers. But an open office with one sales guy screaming “hey I good work
dude” to another (been there) irks me tremendously.

> For all its lofty aims, ironically, the building fell short in the face of
> some scientific truths – that, for some of us, listening to other people’s
> chit-chat can be about as enraging as having a colleague repeatedly click
> their pen against your forehead.

## [Liskov Substitution Principle is…Not a Design Principle (SOLID is not solid)](https://naildrivin5.com/blog/2019/11/18/liskov-substitution-principle-is-not-a-design-principle.html)
I’ve never been a fan of many design principles, since there can always be cases
where there is a good reason to break a principle (making it a non-principle).

## [Phonetography: Does This Enhance or Diminish Our Enjoyment of an Experience?](https://bulletproofmusician.com/phonetography-does-this-enhance-or-diminish-our-enjoyment-of-an-experience/)
Transcription of an episode of The Bulletproof Musician (a podcast on techniques
to improve your musical training), where two articles studying whether taking
pictures improves the enjoyment of an experience.

## [History as a giant data set: how analysing the past could help save the future](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/history-as-a-giant-data-set-how-analysing-the-past-could-help-save-the-future)
Psychohistory anyone?

## [TROS: How IBM mainframes stored microcode in transformers](http://www.righto.com/2019/11/tros-how-ibm-mainframes-stored.html?m=1)
> Why microcode? One of the hardest parts of computer design is creating the
> control logic that tells each part of the processor what to do to carry out
> each instruction. In 1951, Maurice Wilkes came up with the idea of microcode:
> instead of building the control logic from complex logic gate circuitry, the
> control logic could be replaced with code (i.e. microcode) stored in a special
> memory called a control store. To execute an instruction, the computer
> internally executes several simpler micro-instructions, which are specified by
> the microcode. With microcode, building the processor's control logic becomes
> a programming task instead of a logic design task.

## [Tokyo’s amazing 2D Cafe looks like an illustration, but it’s an actual restaurant you can eat in!](https://soranews24.com/2019/09/01/tokyos-amazing-2d-cafe-looks-like-an-illustration-but-its-an-actual-restaurant-you-can-eat-in/)
This is some serious trompe l’oeil.

## [Working with HTTP in Polynote](https://blog.softwaremill.com/working-with-http-in-polynote-d950dcfcd75f)
I mentioned [Polynote](https://polynote.org) (Netflix’s polyglot notebook for
Scala, Spark and Python especially)
[before](https://mostlymaths.net/2019/10/201929-readings-of-the-week.html/).
People are starting to use it for “things”.

## [The Context Stack: a new way to visualize game rules](https://www.northstargames.com/blogs/secret-fun/the-context-stack)
Shared by a game designer friend (he just opened a [Kickstarter for his latest
game](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magnategame/magnate-the-first-city)!).
You know [I’m a sucker for using visual representations of
knowledge](https://mostlymaths.net/2019/07/a-section-of-map-of-data-engineering.html/),
so this is just right there for me.

## [The cargo ships that ‘liquefy’](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180905-the-cargo-ships-that-liquefy)
A super weird physical phenomenon that makes cargo ships capsize and disappear.

## [Bebugging (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebugging)
This is similar to metamorphic testing, but done manually. It's an interesting
idea and worth doing, it's cheap.

## [I was an astrologer – here's how it really works, and why I had to stop](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/06/i-was-an-astrologer-how-it-works-psychics)
There's a recent surge in astrology in VC funds: not for choosing the
investment, but for investing in "astrology as a service" systems (to be fair, 7
or 8 years ago I thought about writing one...). This is more on the personal
side, but interesting nonetheless.

## [Pour at Your Own Risk: America Warms to a Spill-Prone Wine Jug](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/dining/drinks/porron-wine.html)
Pretty absurd and hardcore cultural appropriation. You are terribly unlikely to
see a Spaniard or Catalan drinking from a "porró" (the Catalan word for the
thingy). I've seen it used more frequently as an alternate oil jug than for
drinking wine, here.

## [Really fast Markov chains in ~20 lines of sh, grep, cut and awk](https://0x0f0f0f.github.io/posts/2019/11/really-fast-markov-chains-in-~20-lines-of-sh-grep-cut-and-awk/)
You can do pretty amazing things with AWK. And AWK is pretty readable, too.

## [10 Ways to Tweak Slow SQL Queries](http://www.helenanderson.co.nz/sql-query-tweaks/)
One caveat: CTEs are cool and great, but they can sometimes ruin your query
planner.

## [Failing 15% of the time is the best way to learn, say scientists](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/failing-study-success-machine-learning-a9186051.html)
It is well known that learning needs failure at a point where you are still
challenged. A new study suggests this is the correct rate of failure for maximal
learning.

## [performance - Why is Haskell (GHC) so darn fast? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35027952/why-is-haskell-ghc-so-darn-fast) 
An attorney would say this is leading the witness. A stack overflow question,
but the answers on why a lazy, very functional language is decently fast once
compiled is interesting.

## [Teeline for the curious: a story of learning things because I can](http://realerthinks.com/teeline-for-the-curious-a-story-of-learning-things-because-i-can/)
I learnt Catalan shorthand [many years
ago](https://mostlymaths.net/2009/05/shorthand.html/) (loosely based on Gregg).
I found out about Teeline here, and I think this is the one I should learn now.

## [Build your own Kafka in ZIO - ZIO Queues & ZIO Fibers](https://scalac.io/build-your-own-kafka-in-zio-queues-fibers/)
A low level example of using ZIO, to get to know its underlying principles.
Don't assume this is _like_ Kafka!

## [One Word of Code to Stop Using Pandas So Slowly](https://towardsdatascience.com/one-word-of-code-to-stop-using-pandas-so-slowly-793e0a81343c)
TL;DR (because the title is not that clear either) is to use
[swifter](https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/swifter), a library that dynamically
chooses Pandas methods or Dask methods to be as efficient as possible.

## [The tiger next door: America’s backyard big cats](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/nov/10/the-tiger-next-door-americas-backyard-big-cats)
The land of the free, unless you are a tiger.

## [Apps We're Trying: Alternative Window Managers for macOS](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps-were-trying-alternative-window-managers-for-macos/)
The Sweet Setup has always interesting articles on iOS and Mac apps. This time
they tried their hand at tiling window managers for Mac. I used some in the past
myself ([Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) and kwm, the predecesor of
[chunkwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm)). Nowadays I use
[Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix) with custom-written commands to
split windows in certain ways.

## [Comparing Performance between Apache Spark and PySpark](https://medium.com/@sahandfarazzarrinkoub/comparing-performance-between-apache-spark-and-pyspark-63d68c067a55) 
I'm slightly dubious of the result (reading should be as fast in both).

## [Parallel Commits: An Atomic Commit Protocol For Globally Distributed Transactions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/parallel-commits)
I forgot most of it almost immediately, although to be fair the same happened
with two-phase commit.

## [Stellar Sonata - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Sonata)
A musical painting. Brilliant.

## [Scala's isInstanceOf is an Anti-Pattern](https://alexn.org/blog/2019/08/11/isinstanceof-anti-pattern.html)
Yeah, indeed.

## [🍿 DASK and Apache Spark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM95j7FNA6M&feature=youtu.be)
A talk from North America's Spark Summit 2019 about Dask.

## [📚 Refuse to choose](https://www.amazon.com/Refuse-Choose-Interests-Passions-Hobbies-ebook/dp/B000SEKMS8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=refuse+to+choose&qid=1574600413&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=2ddc2f5ec4a3756ebc04855b7536616e&language=en_US)
The book I mention on the first article. It was deeply touching, realising "I'm
not the only one" with this kind of thirst for different things. It was also
revealing in how to approach multiple passions and hobbies, and what to do to
take full advantage of this. Read it, ASAP. Especially if you like the eclectic
selection of topics I offer.

## [🔊 The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=VWR62OC1Q8Q1&keywords=the+man+who+solved+the+market&qid=1574600609&sprefix=man+solved+market+'+',aps,236&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=265040b18e6d90e729d52523bbf5d3d6&language=en_US)
Very interesting, with a surprising amount of mentions of familiar
mathematicians. It's more of a biography of Renaissance, more than Simons, but
it's interesting nonetheless.
