## [Building columnar compression in a row-oriented database](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-columnar-compression-in-a-row-oriented-database/)
Some of the details remind me of how Redshift handles queries and indexing (i.e.
[zone maps](https://www.google.com/search?q=redshift zone map)).

## [How Lyft Designs the Machine Learning Software Engineering Interview](https://eng.lyft.com/how-lyft-designs-the-machine-learning-software-engineering-interview-bbbb9fc8bb28)
Their approach was more interesting than expected. Picked up a few ideas.

## [Where Theory Meets Chalk, Dust Flies - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/science/mathematicians-blackboard-photographs-jessica-wynne.html)
If you find the subject interesting (I do) you may enjoy [A topological
picturebook](https://www.amazon.com/Topological-Picturebook-George-K-Francis/dp/0387345426/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=J9OSJJLOJIN2&keywords=topological+picture+book&qid=1572735083&sprefix=topological+picture,aps,228&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=61d9fc27ec99b1a1b4228f78c9143d54&language=en_US).

## [Adding a macro parser to my Scheme implementation](https://0x0f0f0f.github.io/posts/2019/10/adding-a-macro-parser-to-my-scheme-implementation/)
It‚Äôs a Scheme ([R5RS](https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/) compliant)
written in Haskell, work in progress. Even with my limited understanding of
Haskell I could follow (of course, I have a relatively good understanding of how
Lisp and Scheme are implemented and parsed).

## [The hidden cost of Spark withColumn](https://medium.com/@manuzhang/the-hidden-cost-of-spark-withcolumn-8ffea517c015)
Catalyst can add a surprisingly large amount of overhead. Of course, this is
kind of an extreme case. Worth noting, you can use `RuleExecutor.dumpTimeSpent`
to analyze how long Catalyst takes.

## [Cult of the party parrot: How a ridiculous bird became an emoji hero](https://mashable.com/2017/07/13/cult-of-the-party-parrot-slack-reddit-meme/)
All hail the mighty parrot.

## [Did Netflix just kill Databricks with releasing Polynote for free?](https://medium.com/@brianray_7981/did-netflix-just-kill-databricks-with-releasing-polynote-for-free-c2d1f6dc0da3)
This is disingenuous as a title (or, a perfect application of [Betteridge‚Äôs
law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)).
[Polynote](https://polynote.org) (as good as it is and may become, mentioned
briefly [last
week](https://mostlymaths.net/2019/10/201929-readings-of-the-week.html/)) is
_not_ what Databricks makes money off.

## [A simple integration test using Scala and ZIO](https://blog.jdriven.com/2019/10/a-simple-integration-test-using-scala-and-zio/)
I keep collecting samples of [ZIO](https://zio.dev) code for the day I write
something longer than 5 lines with it. This is super-clear code, by the way.

## [Small & fast Docker images using GraalVM‚Äôs native-image](https://blog.softwaremill.com/small-fast-docker-images-using-graalvms-native-image-99c0bc92e70b)
A thorough tutorial on creating [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org)-native
compiled stuff.

## [Teach Yourself to Echolocate](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/teach-yourself-to-echolocate)
I like knowing weird things.

## [What Does a Coder Do If They Can‚Äôt Type?](http://nsaphra.github.io/post/hands/)
I‚Äôve been setting up and using sparingly [Talon](http://talonvoice.com), after
watching [Emily Shea](https://mobile.twitter.com/yomilly)‚Äôs talk (below). I can
type, but this feels like insurance for the future: I can type now and configure
it, just in case.

## [Evaporative Cooling of Group Beliefs](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZQG9cwKbct2LtmL3p/evaporative-cooling-of-group-beliefs)
This explains how cults become entrenched after failure and how online
communities dissolve.

## [Crossword Panic of 1944](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Crossword-Panic-of-1944/)
An interesting historical tidbit.

## [pagemap ¬∑ mini map for web pages](https://larsjung.de/pagemap/)
A small Javascript plugin to show Sublime Text style minimaps in webpages. You
can see it in play by hovering over the left area of the page on large posts
here, like this
[one](https://mostlymaths.net/2019/07/a-section-of-map-of-data-engineering.html/).

## [Inside the iPhone 11 Camera, Part 1: A Completely New Camera](https://blog.halide.cam/inside-the-iphone-11-camera-part-1-a-completely-new-camera-28ea5d091071)
I have a 3 year old iPhone, and the amount of advancements in camera technology
is probably the only tempting thing about the newer models. NOTE: between
writing this and publishing, the battery of my iPhone 7 has given up completely,
so tomorrow I may be getting a new iPhone `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

## [How To Create Optimized Docker Images For Production](https://haydenjames.io/how-to-create-optimized-docker-images-for-production/)
Incremental builds, using small images like Alpine. Not mentioned, but using
[dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) is an additional possibility to reduce
layer size (tip from the team at [BitPhy](http://bitphy.com/en/)).

## [Weird things you can, but probably shouldn't do in Python](https://thoughts.willcipriano.com/weird-python-tricks/)
Never do this. Or at least not in production

## [Visual Studio Remotes: Simplifying developer environments](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/10/08/Vscode-remotes.html)
You can use remote machines or Docker images as code analyzing backends. This
can give [Tramp](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode) a run for its money.

## [ITAPPMONROBOT](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/ITAPPMONROBOT)
Old school Kubernetes control plane?

## [Autoantonyms](http://www.fun-with-words.com/nym_autoantonyms.html)
An autoantonym is a word which is its own reverse, depending on context.

## [Haskell build systems for non-Haskellers](https://sigkill.dk/blog/2019-10-17-haskell-build-systems-for-non-haskellers.html)
I had a keyboard smashing afternoon trying to get a sample project to build in
Haskell. I remember having the same feeling with Scala when I started, so I hope
I eventually get familiar with it as well.

## [üçø Voice Driven Development: Who needs a keyboard anyway?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YKuRkGkf5HU&list=PLcGKfGEEONaCToXJZ4Uk1NVW70U3C-Im-&index=15&t=0s)
I have been interested in voice coding since I saw [this other
video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI), 6 years ago. We all know too
much typing can lead to RSI and similar issues. The time to address it is
_before_ you reach that point, hence I‚Äôm trying it these days. I'll be writing
my findings and configurations "soon" (the idea was to do it last during the
previous week, so go figure).

## [üçø What We Know We Don't Know](http://youtube.com/watch?v=WELBnE33dpY)
It‚Äôs the first time I see Hillel presenting. This was a very interesting talk
about... well, it‚Äôs hard to know.


## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS
went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters
I‚Äôm subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your
case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).
