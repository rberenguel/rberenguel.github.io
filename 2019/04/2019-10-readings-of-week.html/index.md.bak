If you are wondering why the list is shorter this week (and is so late) is because [last week I said I was going to play Stardew Valley](https://www.mostlymaths.net/2019/04/2019-9-readings-of-week-x4.html), and I complied. Oh, I also played a bit with creating fun models with Alloy, maybe I'll explain something soon.


[The Day Feynman Worked Out Black-Hole Radiation on My Blackboard](http://m.nautil.us/blog/the-day-feynman-worked-out-black_hole-radiation-on-my-blackboard)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The way Richard Feynman found interesting stuff and just had a go (have you read Surely you’re joking, Mr Feynman?) is astonishing.

[How to Set Up VSCode for Remote Pair Programming](https://medium.com/@ibrahimbutt/how-to-set-up-vscode-for-remote-pair-programming-e5f5c30a48e2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been researching better ways to help my coworkers while I’m remote. This VS Code setup looks interesting, although I’ll need to get an emacs/vim plugin if I am to use it.

[SIGBOVIK](http://colinm.org/sigbovik/)
---------------------------------------

If you run OCR on paint splashes, you get mostly valid Perl code.

[Multi-Scale Truchet Patterns](https://christophercarlson.com/portfolio/multi-scale-truchet-patterns/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I always enjoy a good generative art finding, and Truchet tiles have always claimed a spot in my heart (I loved [Cameron Browne’s Che](http://cambolbro.com/games/index.html) game, even if it's a bit thin after a while)

[How Mental Models Unlock Your Thinking](https://fs.blog/general-thinking-concepts/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I follow Shane’s podcast (and newsletter) regularly, so I’ve been looking forward the release of his audiobook. Now, it’s here, and I got it already.

[Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
---------------------------------------

These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters I’m subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).
