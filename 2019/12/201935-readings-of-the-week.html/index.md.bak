A flight last Sunday meant I was so sleepy I skipped sending last week's newsletter‚Ä¶ so this week is super-sized. A lot of content about distributed teams I think.

<!--more-->

**NOTE**: Scala, distributed teams and a bit of a random selection. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag here](https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek). You can also get these as a weekly newsletter by subscribing [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).

## [A Recession Hasn‚Äôt Arrived (Yet). Here‚Äôs Where You‚Äôll See It First](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/business/economy/economy-recession.html)
The title sounds more exciting than the content, and it's from The New York Times, so beware the paywall. I think it's worth remembering the economy has been acting weirdly for a while

## [The wonders of the suffix tree through the lens of Ukkonen‚Äôs Algorithm](https://humanreadablemag.com/issues/0/articles/the-wonders-of-the-suffix-tree-through-the-lens-of-ukkonen%E2%80%99s-algorithm/)
Suffix trees are excellent for certain search problems (many documents or large document for a limited amount of patterns or variable patterns). Its dual (many documents or large documents for many patterns) would he Aho-Corasick's algorithm (or some of its improvements)

## [The World Has Gone Mad and the System Is Broken](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-has-gone-mad-system-broken-ray-dalio/)
Building on the first article of the week, and also what seems to be clear: the system is flush with stupid money.

## [Homology](http://tungsteno.io/post/exp-homology/)
If you can get past some of the typos, this is an excellent explanation of homology.

## [Star Trek: The Next Generation In 40 Hours - Maxistentialism Blog - Medium](https://medium.com/maxistentialism-blog/star-trek-the-next-generation-in-40-hours-c4a6762cbd3)
I recently re-watched the whole TNG (I think it may have been the 3rd time for me) with my partner. And indeed, watching everything is a bit of a chore: the selection here is what I would have also picked, and I think builds up correctly up to Inner Light.

## [Monads aren't as hard as you think](https://bytes.yingw787.com/posts/2019/12/06/monads/)
Monads‚Ä¶ in Python. And also, well explained. I prefer to think as monads as "containers offering a way to be merged together" (as in‚Ä¶ functor‚Ä¶ monoid) but the explanation here (and the Python class magic) are good.

## [Beginners Guide to Columnar File Formats in Spark and Hadoop](https://blog.matthewrathbone.com/2019/11/21/guide-to-columnar-file-formats.html)
In case you don't know what columnar is (and haven't watched any of my presentations with animated drawings), read this.

## [How to Setup AWS Lambda in Scala without any external Library](https://edward-huang.com/aws/cloud/2019/11/28/how-to-setup-aws-lambda-in-scala-without-any-external-library/)
This seems promising. Lambda everything.

## [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/)
I saw this recently in Twitter (not sure who shared, it was a "Scala person"), and I remembered reading it when it was posted. Since it was before Readings of the Week started, I think it never got shared, so enjoy.

## [What are Wardley Maps? Using Miro for Wardley Mapping](https://miro.com/blog/wardley-maps-whiteboard-canvas/)
I've been exploring possible solutions to "remote whiteboard" and Miro seems an excellent proposition. It's like a better version of LucidCharts, but with real time editing capabilities. Also, Wardley maps, yes. Obviously it's written by Ben, who is everywhere maps appear ü§£

## [Three ways to reduce the costs of your HTTP(S) API on AWS](https://gameanalytics.com/blog/reduce-costs-https-api-aws.html)
Reducing the size of certificate chain is something we have investigated to speed up SSL interchanges, not for size. But it's good to read what options are for really high volume systems.

## [üé¨ Grow your own tech leads](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/kenbot/grow-your-own-tech-leads)
Slides of a presentation. Good tips

## ["My Car does not start when I buy Vanilla Ice Cream", said a Man to General Motors](https://www.digitalrepublik.com/digital-marketing-newsletter/2015/05/10/my-car-does-not-start-when-i-buy-vanilla-ice-cream-said-a-man-to-general-motors/)
Weird bugs are weird.

## [The Dogs Ate SoftBank‚Äôs Money - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-12-10/the-dogs-ate-softbank-s-money)
Another SoftBank related article. It's getting even more mad.

## [Netflix tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/netflix/status/1202669582407782400)
An humorous tweet by Netflix CM‚Ä¶ Best of the Internet this year. Check the answers.

## [scala - What's the difference between => , ()=>, and Unit=>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4543228/whats-the-difference-between-and-unit#4545703)
Good to know if you use Scala.

## [How a Bottle of Wine Can Help Your Public Speaking](https://www.activepresence.com/blog/public-speaking-articulation-exercise)
Does _not_ imply drinking it.

## [How to Make Remote a Success](https://www.bearer.sh/blog/how-to-make-remote-a-success)
Remote is hard, any help is welcome

## [Run for the balls: West Ham team up with Iron Maiden for new kit](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/29/run-for-the-balls-west-ham-team-up-with-iron-maiden-for-new-kit)
I found the headline (and the ukulele bearing) hilarious.

## [Yes! and‚Ä¶](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/)
Classic improv technique, but don't use it with your product owner.

## [The Product-Minded Software Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/)
Speaking of product owners?

## [Force Field Analysis](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_06.htm)
Yet another "change generation" approach to identify leverage points.

## [The Gambler Who Cracked the Horse-Racing Code](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-gambler-who-cracked-the-horse-racing-code)
This was a fascinating read.

## [Monopoly Was Invented to Demonstrate the Evils of Capitalism](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/monopoly-was-invented-to-demonstrate-the-evils-of-capitalism)
Go figure: Monopoly is not what you thought of it.

## [Progressive Summarization: A Practical Technique for Designing Discoverable Notes](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes-3459b257d3eb/)
I had read this before, and it can be a bit confusing. TL;DR: get plenty of notes, highlight them later, bold the highlighted material, and if they are still large, summarise the bold.

## [Performant Python](https://strangemachines.io/articles/performant-python)
Tips and tricks for fast Python.

## [Recording meetup talks on a low budget](http://dukebody.com/?p=527)
This is what we do at [PyBCN](https://pybcn.org)‚Ä¶ because Isra is one of the members of the recording team. We are actually investing in better systems for next year, but as a starter this was excellent.

## [How ‚Äúrandomizers‚Äù are breathing new life into old games](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/)
I read about randomisers in a Hillel Wayne article ([PROVING GAMES ARE WINNABLE WITH ALLOY](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/alloy-randomizer/), probably the best intro to Alloy ever). This is a more detailed view of what they are than that one though.

## [How busyness leads to bad decisions](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20191202-how-time-scarcity-makes-us-focus-on-low-value-tasks)
Basically, not having margin (or slack) in your system is a bad idea.

## [A Distributed Meeting Primer](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/a-distributed-meeting-primer/)
More remote working things. Sorry, distributed working.

## [Behind the screens at The Guardian](https://able.bio/rhett/behind-the-screens-at-the-guardian--80gf2hy)
Details on The Guardian's tech stack. They are strong in Scala!

## ["Harbinger households": neighbourhoods that consistently buy products that get discontinued, buy real-estate that underperforms, and donate to losing political candidates](https://boingboing.net/2019/12/03/harbringer-of-doom.html)
The paper mentioned in this article is now on my reading list.
