<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Scala, distributed teams and a bit of a random selection. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the <a href="https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/Readings">tag here</a>.

<p>The title sounds more exciting than the content, and it&rsquo;s from The New York Times, so beware the paywall. I think it&rsquo;s worth remembering the economy has been acting weirdly for a while</p>
<h2 id="the-wonders-of-the-suffix-tree-through-the-lens-of-ukkonens-algorithmhttpshumanreadablemagcomissues0articlesthe-wonders-of-the-suffix-tree-through-the-lens-of-ukkonene28099s-algorithm"><a href="https://humanreadablemag.com/issues/0/articles/the-wonders-of-the-suffix-tree-through-the-lens-of-ukkonen%E2%80%99s-algorithm/">The wonders of the suffix tree through the lens of Ukkonen’s Algorithm</a></h2>
<p>Suffix trees are excellent for certain search problems (many documents or large document for a limited amount of patterns or variable patterns). Its dual (many documents or large documents for many patterns) would he Aho-Corasick&rsquo;s algorithm (or some of its improvements)</p>
<h2 id="the-world-has-gone-mad-and-the-system-is-brokenhttpswwwlinkedincompulseworld-has-gone-mad-system-broken-ray-dalio"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-has-gone-mad-system-broken-ray-dalio/">The World Has Gone Mad and the System Is Broken</a></h2>
<p>Building on the first article of the week, and also what seems to be clear: the system is flush with stupid money.</p>
<h2 id="homologyhttptungstenoiopostexp-homology"><a href="http://tungsteno.io/post/exp-homology/">Homology</a></h2>
<p>If you can get past some of the typos, this is an excellent explanation of homology.</p>

<p>I recently re-watched the whole TNG (I think it may have been the 3rd time for me) with my partner. And indeed, watching everything is a bit of a chore: the selection here is what I would have also picked, and I think builds up correctly up to Inner Light.</p>
<h2 id="monads-arent-as-hard-as-you-thinkhttpsbytesyingw787composts20191206monads"><a href="https://bytes.yingw787.com/posts/2019/12/06/monads/">Monads aren&rsquo;t as hard as you think</a></h2>
<p>Monads… in Python. And also, well explained. I prefer to think as monads as &ldquo;containers offering a way to be merged together&rdquo; (as in… functor… monoid) but the explanation here (and the Python class magic) are good.</p>
<h2 id="beginners-guide-to-columnar-file-formats-in-spark-and-hadoophttpsblogmatthewrathbonecom20191121guide-to-columnar-file-formatshtml"><a href="https://blog.matthewrathbone.com/2019/11/21/guide-to-columnar-file-formats.html">Beginners Guide to Columnar File Formats in Spark and Hadoop</a></h2>
<p>In case you don&rsquo;t know what columnar is (and haven&rsquo;t watched any of my presentations with animated drawings), read this.</p>

<p>This seems promising. Lambda everything.</p>
<h2 id="what-nobody-tells-you-about-documentationhttpswwwdiviocomblogdocumentation"><a href="https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/">What nobody tells you about documentation</a></h2>
<p>I saw this recently in Twitter (not sure who shared, it was a &ldquo;Scala person&rdquo;), and I remembered reading it when it was posted. Since it was before Readings of the Week started, I think it never got shared, so enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-wardley-maps-using-miro-for-wardley-mappinghttpsmirocomblogwardley-maps-whiteboard-canvas"><a href="https://miro.com/blog/wardley-maps-whiteboard-canvas/">What are Wardley Maps? Using Miro for Wardley Mapping</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring possible solutions to &ldquo;remote whiteboard&rdquo; and Miro seems an excellent proposition. It&rsquo;s like a better version of LucidCharts, but with real time editing capabilities. Also, Wardley maps, yes. Obviously it&rsquo;s written by Ben, who is everywhere maps appear 🤣</p>
<h2 id="three-ways-to-reduce-the-costs-of-your-https-api-on-awshttpsgameanalyticscomblogreduce-costs-https-api-awshtml"><a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/reduce-costs-https-api-aws.html">Three ways to reduce the costs of your HTTP(S) API on AWS</a></h2>
<p>Reducing the size of certificate chain is something we have investigated to speed up SSL interchanges, not for size. But it&rsquo;s good to read what options are for really high volume systems.</p>

<p>I had read this before, and it can be a bit confusing. TL;DR: get plenty of notes, highlight them later, bold the highlighted material, and if they are still large, summarise the bold.</p>

<p>This is what we do at <a href="https://pybcn.org">PyBCN</a>… because Isra is one of the members of the recording team. We are actually investing in better systems for next year, but as a starter this was excellent.</p>

<p>I read about randomisers in a Hillel Wayne article (<a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/alloy-randomizer/">PROVING GAMES ARE WINNABLE WITH ALLOY</a>, probably the best intro to Alloy ever). This is a more detailed view of what they are than that one though.</p>
