This week is somewhat more eclectic than usual. There is nothing about any
particular programming language. There is a bit on Kubernetes, functional
programming and containers, project management, aviation history,
interviews/bios‚Ä¶ I have started reading a few more papers, and I‚Äôll share the
interesting ones as well. This week they are centered in data engineering.

**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links.
Kubernetes, functional programming and containers, project management, aviation
history, interviews/bios‚Ä¶ Expect a similar wide range in the future as well.

## [Planet Satellite: British super-plane or magnesium flop?](https://hushkit.net/2015/10/16/whisky-business-the-strange-story-of-the-planet-satellite/)
I have a strange attraction to stories about weird engineering projects. This one is about a plane that was supposed to democratise flight, bringing an airplane to every home.

## [Death Star II: A Project Management Case Study](https://medium.com/@HybridAnalyst/death-star-ii-a-project-management-case-study-7e9ce087cc08)
This feels almost like the story of the [Vasa](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/bizarre-story-vasa-ship-keeps-giving-180964328/), but in a fictional, planet-destroyer level.

## [After WeWork, SoftBank‚Äôs Startup Bookkeeping Draws Scrutiny](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-26/after-wework-softbank-s-startup-bookkeeping-draws-scrutiny)
This feels like financial engineering at its finest. Reminds me of this [37Signals joke post](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1941-press-release-37signals-valuation-tops-100-billion-after-bold-vc-investment) from some years ago.

## [TLA+ model checking made symbolic](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/11/29/tla-model-checking-made-symbolic/)
A quick overview of this paper, which essentially introduces a type checker for a subset of TLA+ and then converts it into SMT-acceptable rules. This enables checking certain properties in reasonable time (i.e. finite).

## [The Sociologist and Space Engineers Behind Orba, Artiphon's New Instrument for Everyone](https://www.core77.com/posts/91471/The-Sociologist-and-Space-Engineers-Behind-Orba-Artiphons-New-Instrument-for-Everyone)
I‚Äôm a sucker for musical instruments, and this looked so fun I couldn‚Äôt help but back it in Kickstarter.

## [My Life as a Child Chef](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/25/my-life-as-a-child-chef)
Following your passion sometimes leads somewhere else.

## [Kleisli Category ‚Äî From theory to Cats](https://blog.softwaremill.com/kleisli-category-from-theory-to-cats-fbd140bf396e)
It won‚Äôt be super enlightening, but can help clarify what [Kleisli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleisli_category) stands for.

## [Barbara Liskov Is the Architect of Modern Algorithms](https://www.quantamagazine.org/barbara-liskov-is-the-architect-of-modern-algorithms-20191120/)
An excellent interview with Dr. Liskov (the L from [SOLID](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)). It‚Äôs hard reading how bad women/underrepresented groups have had it (and have) it in the field. We need to do our best together to fix this.

## [Remember Clusterman? Now It's Open-Source, and Supports Kubernetes Too!](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2019/11/open-source-clusterman.html)
Back when I was investigating moving all our systems to Kubernetes, autoscaling (especially if I wanted to run Spark on the same cluster) was what looked thornier. From the looks of it, [Clusterman](https://github.com/Yelp/clusterman) by Yelp might be the answer.

## [Why Is There No Docker in OpenShift 4 and RHEL 8?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/part-ii-why-docker-openshift-4-rhel-8-scott-mccarty/)
I‚Äôm not superhappy with the names chosen for the smaller tools, but breaking up the monster is a good reason.

## [Mind of a Mathematician](https://paw.princeton.edu/article/mind-mathematician)
A short bio of Terence Tao, one of the best mathematicians alive.

## [‚ÄúYou Don‚Äôt Bring Bad News to the Cult Leader‚Äù: Inside the Fall of WeWork](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/inside-the-fall-of-wework)
Another WeWork themed article, and an interesting one. Seen from the outside you can‚Äôt help wonder _how nobody realized?_

## [A list of Haskell articles on good design, good testing](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-24-design-and-testing-articles.html)
Not the first time a post by [William Yao](https://twitter.com/williamyaoh) makes it t this list. It's likely some of the articles recommended here will appear in future issues of my weekly readings.

## [üìù How to Architect a Query Compiler, Revisited](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/rompf/papers/tahboub-sigmod18.pdf)
A paper involving Tiark Rompf, whom you may know as involved in [Flare](https://flaredata.github.io), an optimizer for Spark that can reach 10x speed ups. The details in this article should feel as part of the reason ([technically I‚Äôm horribly wrong](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08219.pdf) since Flare uses only [LMS](http://scala-lms.github.io), but‚Ä¶ I have a hunch there is a lot of overlap). In short, explains how you can specialize (query) interpreters to form the basis for efficient compiled code (similar, but nope, different, than what [Catalyst](https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-spark-sql/spark-sql-Optimizer.html) does). This is achieved via a _Futamura projection_ which I may explain later (since I‚Äôd like to read the Futamura paper as well)

## [üìù Performance and Scalability of Broadcast in Spark](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b0e/6a3dc18babb19daddb63890e763795943485.pdf)
A quite old article about improving the efficiency of Spark‚Äôs broadcast. Since [currently the implementation of Spark‚Äôs broadcast](https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-TorrentBroadcast.html) does not follow the results here, the value is limited (except as historical piece).

## Notes I took on _The effect of Work Environments on Productivity and Satisfaction of Software Engineers_

I took some notes on this article, you can read them [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/first-looking-effect-work-environments-productivity-rub%25C3%25A9n-berenguel). Follow/add me to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rberenguel/) in case you want to see these (rarely) posts I write there.

## [üçø Thinking Functionally (by John de Goes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KA3BSdqYug&t=1s)
An excellent talk on [ZIO](https://zio.dev), and I think the ‚Äúdebug by understanding your code‚Äù piece around 30 minutes in is brilliant. _This is how I debug hard problems_. 

## [üîä The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Getting-Things/dp/B01N51TCT1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=the+effective+executive&qid=1575227332&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=00e2d4a324ab0ac6edf1bf51c8d07408&language=en_US)
I‚Äôve had what feels like a business-like week, right? TEE is a classic by Peter Drucker, and everything said in it is as valid now as it was some years ago. It applies not only to ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù, but any knowledge worker, and yes that includes _you_. I‚Äôm also pretty confident I‚Äôll re-read (well, re-listen) to it next year, as I do regularly with _[Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/B01B6WSK5C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=getting+things+done&qid=1575227425&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=4ad213d3dd2cb98473e1ca3deb497000&language=en_US)_.

## [üîä The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business-Anniversary/dp/B00VATFAMI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=the+phoenix+project&qid=1575227241&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=2abdc0eb25d73cbedb2d5754ed725f93&language=en_US)
So fun, it‚Äôs an IT version of _[The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement-Anniversary/dp/B00IFGGDA2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=The+Goal&qid=1575227477&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=ee1de8fa314aba1a6d20f1393d407ba4&language=en_US)_, but even better as a book. It explains theory of constraints, agile methodologies and DevOps in an applied fictional setting, as a novel. By the way, the Audible edition (of the 5 year anniversary edition) is excellently narrated, I listened to it (_14 hours_) in day and a half.

## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters I‚Äôm subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog.
