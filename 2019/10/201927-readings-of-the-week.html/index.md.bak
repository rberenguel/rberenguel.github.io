Some data engineering, a bit of Haskell, programming music, Python and random
bits and bobs. I recommend you play with the third. Several good books this
week, as I have ramped up my reading: current goal would be 52 this year.

**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links. Some
data engineering, a bit of Haskell, programming music, Python. Expect a similar
wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by

## [Whither Literate Programming — What went wrong?](https://medium.com/@torazaburo/whither-literate-programming-2-what-went-wrong-e4a3d89af644)
I tried literate programming for a personal project many years ago (with
[emacs](https://mostlymaths.net/tags/emacs/), it was Javascript), and the main
problem is when you are not sure how you will implement something and need to
repeatedly refactor: you also need to refactor your explanation, which is
painful.

## [You are already smart enough to write Haskell](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-05-you-are-already-smart-enough.html)
I’m inching closer to writing some Haskell code for realz...

## [That Music You’re Dancing To? It’s Code](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/style/live-code-music.html#click=https://t.co/4OYCZ1W4av)
I met [Sam Aaron](https://mobile.twitter.com/samaaron) (and [Sonic
Pi](https://mobile.twitter.com/Sonic_Pi)) at [Scala World](https://scala.world),
I was at his Sonic Pi workshop as well. On my task manager, I have specifically
“play with Sonic Pi”. I love making sounds, and Sonic Pi is awesome. I’d
recommend [Sam’s Scala World
presentation](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6AKRm_bnW_8).

## [PEP 603 -- Adding a frozenmap type to collections](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0603/)
We are inching closer to [Python 4 = Scala
3](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/2491).

## [Data Lake at Robinhood](https://robinhood.engineering/data-lake-at-robinhood-3e9cdf963368)
I like their write up and engine choices.

## [Interview with Weld’s main contributor: accelerating numpy, scikit and pandas as much as 100x with Rust and LLVM](https://notamonadtutorial.com/weld-accelerating-numpy-scikit-and-pandas-as-much-as-100x-with-rust-and-llvm-12ec1c630a1)
> Rust was not the first language in which Weld was implemented; the first
> implementation was in Scala, which was chosen because of its algebraic data
> types and powerful pattern matching. This made writing the optimizer, which is
> the core part of the compiler, very easy. Our original optimizer was based on
> the design of Catalyst, which is Spark SQL’s extensible optimizer. We moved
> away from Scala because it was too difficult to embed a JVM-based language
> into other runtimes and languages.

## [Pipenv: A Guide to the New Python Packaging Tool](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/)
Handling deployable dependencies with pipenv is pretty easy. For managing my
local environments I still prefer [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (with
[pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)) but I could see
[pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) superseding it.

## [Venture Capital Is Putting Its Money Into Astrology](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/style/astrology-apps-venture-capital.html)
I see less money in your future.

## [If someone told you they know Python, what would you expect them to know?](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/d9uakg/if_someone_told_you_they_know_python_what_would/?st=k18hnd7c&sh=6d28d9c9)
A reddit thread I found interesting

## [Python Negatypes](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/negatypes/)
[Hillel Wayne](https://mobile.twitter.com/hillelogram) always writes interesting
stuff. Also he just created a newsletter. [Join
it](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive).

## [The Right Answer? 8,186,699,633,530,061 (An Abacus Makes It Look Almost Easy)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/world/asia/japan-abacus.html)
What can I say? I’m a sucker for [mechanical
computers](https://mostlymaths.net/2013/11/my-russian-kl-1-circular-slide-rule-and.html/).

## [📚 Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years of Lockheed](https://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed/dp/B011M8DBI6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=%F0%9F%93%9A+Skunk+works:+Lockheed+Martin&qid=1570879324&sr=8-1-fkmr0&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=9d70c79ea9fda80a37cbb3cc22b91b51)

This was an excellent read. Covering the history of some of the more iconic airplanes of the 20th century (U-2, F-117A, SR-71), how they came to be and also comes with some lessons which, in hindsight, can be applied to Agile if you want.

## [🔊 Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies](https://www.amazon.com/Blitzscaling-Lightning-Fast-Building-Massively-Companies/dp/B07DJYYG66/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=blitzrcaling&qid=1570879529&s=audible&sr=1-1-spell&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=41343d787c473a47d71f5d71a1f7973c)

I may be unfair to it, but it was a downer. Based on Reid Hoffman's podcast _[Masters of Scale](https://mastersofscale.com)_, it lacks the punch and edition the podcast enjoy. It may be excellent if you haven't heard his podcast, but the podcast is 10x better, and free.

## [📚 Doorways in the sand](https://www.amazon.com/Doorways-Sand-Roger-Zelazny/dp/191144087X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1570879641&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=0401de4e3a7e6ae0f47642d86845c823)

I'm a big Roger Zelazny fan (I'm slowly working to have all his books in paperback or hardcover) and this is quite fun. Bringing some reminisces of the Hammett's flair in the [first Amber book](https://www.amazon.com/Nine-Princes-Amber-Chronicles-Book/dp/B008R63HH2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=chronicles+of+amber&qid=1570880674&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=6aa4b713b62d5c1f6d791c44ced91462) and the absurd of [Slaughterhouse-5](https://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Five/dp/B015EKZX2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=IZH3K3MJL0XT&keywords=slaughterhouse+five&qid=1570880723&s=audible&sprefix=slaugh,audible,215&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=4453d7ad45192d73d32c397f53fb97dd). I may be biased, I really like his writing.

## [📚 The Productivity Project: Accomplishing More by Managing Your Time, Attention, and Energy](https://www.amazon.com/Productivity-Project-Accomplishing-Managing-Attention/dp/1101904054/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=%F0%9F%93%9A+Productivity+project&qid=1570879979&sr=8-1-fkmr1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=fa0aadb12214cb801216320eb9a78db7)

I found this book way better than his newest *[Hyperfocus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525522239/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=4a62d67cb7fccaccf2312ac193172c8f)* , but the latter gets more coverage these days (in any case, if you feel like reading some productivity pr0n and have already read [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/B01B6WSK5C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=getting+things+done&qid=1570880124&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=1985f523431333e2cba6c6fa264b0f93), go for [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/B07RFSSYBH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1570880161&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=3c333c05e346ab2e0fbe0f4dacb56c49)).
