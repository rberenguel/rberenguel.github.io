This is a slightly longer edition because my reading list was overflowing with
400+ articles. I ‚Äútrimmed‚Äù it down to ‚Äúonly‚Äù 380 during this week, I had a lot
of airport time due to going to [Spark Summit
Europe](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe) to give a talk.

**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links. Bread
making, a lot of data engineering, Rust, Agile. Expect a similar wide range in
the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag

## [Blues jamming and Agile](https://hackernoon.com/blues-jamming-and-agile-d78ca4aa9267)
I found it an interesting coincidence: I started attending a Blues Harmonica
course recently, and the example used in this post is exactly about that.

## [A linguistic introduction to d3.js](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/a-linguistic-introduction-to-d3-js-7a40a980bf97)
D3 is super powerful. You wouldn‚Äôt go wrong by learning to use it (and I would
be right in getting my knowledge back, haven‚Äôt written any in 4 years)

## [Appropriate Uses For SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html)
It‚Äôs always convenient to remember that SQLite is more powerful than you think

## [Copernicium Is A Strange Element Indeed](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/10/11/copernicium-is-a-strange-element-indeed)
This was way more interesting than expected.

## [Do-nothing scripting: the key to gradual automation](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/)
I like the idea, it feels philosophically similar to how I automate stuff.

## [How Query Optimizer Works in RDBMS](https://www.pixelstech.net/article/1555763094-How-Query-Optimizer-Works-in-RDBMS)
I love this stuff.

## [Modeling adversaries with TLA+](https://hillelwayne.com/post/adversaries/)
I may have shared this one before. It‚Äôs still great.

## [Why Not Airflow?](https://medium.com/the-prefect-blog/why-not-airflow-4cfa423299c4)
From the [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io) creators, a list of problems with
Airflow. They may be slanted for their own tool, but can‚Äôt disagree with their
issues with Airflow, as an Airflow user. I want to try Prefect next, just in
case. Airflow is... not it.
## [Rust in Avast](https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html)
I have some proof-of-concept Rust code that is miles faster than equivalent (but
unoptimized) Python code. I want to move it forward soon-ish.

## [Privacy Preserving Ad Click Attribution For the Web](https://webkit.org/blog/8943/privacy-preserving-ad-click-attribution-for-the-web/)
I work in adtech, and as such I need to keep up with everything. This looks
convoluted, but privacy preserving. Good enough?

## [Scrum is fragile, not Agile](http://www.dennisweyland.net/blog/?p=43)
I agree with the fragile statement, but not the arguments. Disagree with
agility. I‚Äôll explain my reasoning ‚Äúsoon‚Äù.

## [An Elite Athlete‚Äôs Real-Life Training Plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/well/move/leadville-katie-arnold-ultramarathon-training-parenthood.html)
This can be applied to anything: if you can make your ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù or
‚Äúunrelated‚Äù moments part of your goal, you are almost there.
## [Oliver Byrne: The Matisse of Mathematics](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/oliver-byrne-the-matisse-of-mathematics-byrnes-euclid-geometry-understood-via-color-coded-diagrams)
I haven‚Äôt read Byrne‚Äôs Euclid, but it sits happily in my shelf. It‚Äôs a beautiful
book to peruse. And the drop capitals you see here are from it.

## [Why I Recommend My Clients NOT Use KSQL and Kafka Streams](https://www.jesse-anderson.com/2019/10/why-i-recommend-my-clients-not-use-ksql-and-kafka-streams/)
I have always had an attraction-repulsion with KSQL/streams. I think either
Flink or Spark are better suited for this.

## [Flour power: meet the bread heads baking a better loaf](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/10/flour-power-meet-the-bread-heads-baking-a-better-loaf)
My partner used to prepare sourdough bread twice a week (our sourdough died 3
times so we have stopped for a while).

## [Learning Parser Combinators With Rust](https://bodil.lol/parser-combinators/)
Beware this is somewhat long, but you‚Äôll learn a lot about Ps and Cs, and the F
and M word will appear as well. Highly recommended (if you prefer an Scala
approach, you could get an idea with this one)
## [‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre a data‚Ä¶ something?‚Äù: The Misunderstood Role Of A Data Engineer](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/oh-youre-a-data-something-the-misunderstood-role-of-a-data-engineer-5856a216f240)
It‚Äôs hard to explain...

## [The Rise of the Data Engineer](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-rise-of-the-data-engineer-91be18f1e603)
... and long to explain.

## üîä [Dreaming in Code](https://www.amazon.com/Dreaming-Code-Programmers-Transcendent-Software-dp-B00AQ5DOCA/dp/B00AQ5DOCA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1571479667&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=6af2de79e57a5c83760e31f870b780f7&language=en_US)
An entertaining audiobook about a failed project. The name dropping of people
involved and related is astounding.

## üìΩ [Internals of Speeding PySpark with Arrow](https://github.com/rberenguel/pyspark-arrow-pandas)
Talk I gave this Wednesday at [Spark Summit
Europe](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe). It looks like people liked
it, but of course only people that liked it say so, survivorship bias?

## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS
went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters
I‚Äôm subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your
case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).
