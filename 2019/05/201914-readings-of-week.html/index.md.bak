[Schema Management With Skeema](https://sendgrid.com/blog/schema-management-with-skeema/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How [SendGrid](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5OZmqO5D-7o) manages schema updates internally. A pity it‚Äôs focused on MySQL and family and I prefer Postgres

[How to do hard things](https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wasn‚Äôt aware, but this is exactly how I approach anything I don‚Äôt know how to do. Don‚Äôt miss this one.

[The bullshit I had to go through while organizing a software conference](https://notamonadtutorial.com/the-bullshit-i-had-to-go-through-while-organizing-a-software-conference-4de1225d0acb)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôve been an organiser, luckily didn‚Äôt encounter this. Crossing fingers, since we are preparing stuff at [PyBCN](https://pybcn.org/).

[The reason I am using Altair for most of my visualization in Python](http://fernandoi.cl/blog/posts/altair/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I usually like having the possibility of maximum power and expressiveness... But eventually I just want to make easy things easy. I‚Äôll try [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) next time I need to plot anything. Lately I‚Äôve gone a lot to gnuplot, to be fair: nothing beats it to just plot a text file you have lying around.

[Introducing Argo ‚Äî A Container-Native Workflow Engine for Kubernetes](https://blog.argoproj.io/introducing-argo-a-container-native-workflow-engine-for-kubernetes-55c0b4b76fac)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what is now being used at [BitPhy](https://www.bitphy.com/en/), after I recommended them to... well, not use [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow). To be fair they were considering [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/) and Airflow, and given they are heavy on Kubernetes, Argo sounds a better fit.

[Do I truly want to become a manager?](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/03/20/do-i-truly-want-to-become-a-manager/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Six questions you should consider before thinking of making the leap out of the IC route. Thanks to CM for sharing it.

[Ask HN: What overlooked class of tools should a self-taught programmer look into](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19900955)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find some suggestions in these answers.

[Give meaning to 100 Billion events a day](https://medium.com/teads-engineering/give-meaning-to-100-billion-events-a-day-part-ii-how-we-use-and-abuse-redshift-to-serve-our-data-bc23d2ed3e07)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How [Teads](https://www.teads.tv/) leverages AWS Redshift.

[Performant Functional Programming to the max with ZIO](http://cloudmark.github.io/A-Journey-To-Zio/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You were wondering: which [ZIO](https://scalaz.github.io/scalaz-zio/) post is he going to share this week?

[Meet Matt Calkins: Billionaire, Board Game God And Tech's Hidden Disruptor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2019/04/29/meet-matt-calkins-billionaire-board-game-god-and-techs-hidden-disruptor/amp/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A friend of mine is designing and producing a board game (I‚Äôll share the Kickstarter when is ready), so this was a fun read. He‚Äôs not a billionaire though.

[Open-sourcing the first OpenRTB Scala framework](https://powerspace.tech/open-sourcing-the-first-openrtb-scala-framework-686dde0a0d40)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm not sure what the performance of a [RTB](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/real-time-bidding-rtb-project/) can be in Scala, but I‚Äôm definitely interested.

[Zero Cost Abstractions](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is always _sold_ as a zero-cost abstraction language. What does that exactly mean?

[A novel data-compression technique for faster computer programs](https://techxplore.com/news/2019-04-data-compression-technique-faster.html)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don‚Äôt know, this sounds pretty much what [Blosc](http://blosc.org/pages/blosc-in-depth/) does.

[üé• Fast Data with Apache Ignite and Apache Spark](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5OZmqO5D-7o)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(this is an oldie) I tried Ignite+Spark around 1 year ago, and couldn‚Äôt get it to work properly (segmentation fault!). I‚Äôll try again: it can open up a lot of things if it works as promised.

[üé• Thinking for Programmers](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/3-642)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Leslie Lamport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) selling you the why of specifications. Very recommended, specially for people who think specifying is complex, long, unnecessary or anti-agile.

[üé• Live Coding with Rust and Actix](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wFe1g3cLLso)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was very impressed by this video (I watched it as ‚Äúbackground‚Äù, not actively). Very focused, and all written in one go.

[üé• Solving every-day data problems with FoundationDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKcF3HPnYqg&index=17&list=PLbzoR-pLrL6q7uYN-94-p_-Q3hyAmpI7o)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[FoundationDB](https://www.foundationdb.org/) is on my list of technologies to watch/follow and learn. Get a glimpse about why here.

[üìö Soft Skills](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-Software-Developers-Manual/dp/B0158SJ3EM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=soft+skills&qid=1558783110&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=660334b6bd6b4ca2ac87308f0e6e81af&language=en_US)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It‚Äôs not a bad book, but is basically a summary of stuff I got from other places already. You can give it a go.

[üéº Time Out by the Dave Brubeck Quartet](https://music.apple.com/es/album/time-out/316351910?l=en)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saw this recommended somewhere, and I‚Äôm liking it a lot (won‚Äôt remove Bill Evans as my favourite jazz pianist though)

[Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
