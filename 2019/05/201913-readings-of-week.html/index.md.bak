[Ancient Chinese Buildings Are Held Together With Rice](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/chinese-architecture)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As everyone who has prepared sticky rice and forgotten to clean the pan quickly knows.  

['I'd Have These Extremely Graphic Dreams': What It's Like To Work On Ultra-Violent Games](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/05/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-to-work-on-ultra-violent-games-like-mortal-kombat-11/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fatality burnout.  

[The Artistry of Chinaâ€™s Ivory Puzzle Balls](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/puzzle-balls-from-guangzhou)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iâ€™ve seen one from really close and they are amazing  

[Bristol academic cracks Voynich code](https://phys.org/news/2019-05-bristol-academic-voynich-code-century-old.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a [rebuttal](https://ciphermysteries.com/2017/11/10/gerard-cheshire-vulgar-latin-siren-call-polyglot) of this approach close to 2 years ago, but it still sounds interesting. Also, Iâ€™d expect phys.org to be somewhat trustable.  

[Technical Debt? Probably not.](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/019-01ff/tech-debt/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pay it off. Or not.  

[Scala's Future.successful: Do Not Block Your Future Success](https://blog.colinbreck.com/future-successful-blocking-your-future-success/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beware the future!  

[The Functional Scala Concurrency Challenge](http://degoes.net/articles/zio-challenge)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the solutions look neat, and there is something to be learnt in the diversity.  

[Technical overview of ads viewability measurement methods](https://adtechmadness.wordpress.com/2019/03/13/technical-overview-of-ads-viewability-measurement-methods/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have always been interested into how ad viewability (if an ad is seen by a user or not) works. Now I know.  

[GraalVM installation and setup on macOS](https://blog.softwaremill.com/graalvm-installation-and-setup-on-macos-294dd1d23ca2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GraalVM is a new Java runtime and compiler, which is somewhat faster than the normal JDK, and offers some really fancy cross-language options. I had been using RC9 or 10. It was time to update. I usually use Enterprise Edition for anything local, but can switch per-terminal with several aliases I have (`j8`, `j11`, `jgree` and `jgrce`) in case something breaks or I want to try another.  

[Caire - a content aware image resize library](http://www.esimov.com/2019/05/caire-a-content-aware-image-resizing-library)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seam carving is so cool. I wrote a cropping system once, using PILs Haar cascade based object detection. It works pretty well for automated creation of ads, but seam carving is way better for almost all other cases.  

[ðŸŽ¥ Flare - Optimizing Apache Spark for Scale-Up Architectures and Medium-Size Data](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0bqJ2XgLnyc)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iâ€™m scared this will become a closed source, or business-on-top. Code is not available, but results are awesome. Luckily, the papers are (why the code is not as part of the papers is another question).  

[ðŸŽ¥ helm-edit](https://youtu.be/XAHVwhTsF-g)
--------------------------------------------

I had used `multiple-cursors` (and expand-region) in emacs many times, although I had a hard time making it work properly in `spacemacs` for a while. `helm-edit` works better already in `spacemacs`, so, big win!  

[ðŸŽ¥ Understanding Query Plans and Spark UIs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YgQgJceojJY&time_continue=1788)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I knew everything in this video already, but it covers _lots_. Give it a look.  

[ðŸŽ¥ What the Æ’ is a monad](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OSuu8zBBNAA)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Although focused on Java, itâ€™s very well explained for any language. Of course, if you have `do` syntax or for comprehensions, better.  

[ðŸ“š The Great Mental Models](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Mental-Models-Thinking-Concepts-ebook/dp/B07P79P8ST/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=the+great+mental+models&qid=1558276608&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=16c48be80df06620d1b356c031b5cc23&language=en_US)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The audiobook by Shane Parrish, of [FS Blog](https://fs.blog/). It was good, but I expected something longer.  

[ðŸ“š The art of thinking in systems](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Thinking-Systems-Critically-Strategic-ebook/dp/B078YYJBXL/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=the+art+of+thinking+in+systems&qid=1558276558&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=1d0bf29a82ae02b78ed48cbfcdf1781d&language=en_US)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have read Donna Meadows [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=thinking+in+systems&qid=1558276320&s=gateway&sr=8-1&&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=688258fa16496ed626cc3f80c0bf50cd&language=en_US), this wonâ€™t give you anything new. And Iâ€™d rather recommend TiS.
