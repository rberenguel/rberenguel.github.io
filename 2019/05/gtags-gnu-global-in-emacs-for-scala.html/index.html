<p>I looked up what solutions were available, and the only option that seemed good enough was using the classic <code>ctags/etags/gtags</code> I hadn’t used since my C days.</p>

<p>Having a tags implementation can bring an almost-decent jump-to-definition essentially for free: gtags (and the others) work by pre-analysing the data and generating symbol maps which are usually stored as files, the overhead in speed and memory is minimal.</p>

<p>Installing it can get somewhat unintuitive (specially on Mac), since you need <em>very</em> specific settings for it to work with emacs and especially, Scala code.</p>

<p>Start by installing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GLOBAL">GNU global</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">brew install global --with-pygments --with-ctags --with-exuberant-ctags</code></pre></div>
<p>The key parts is having <code>pygments</code>.
Aside from this you will need to export the following environment variables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">GTAGSCONF<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>/usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.conf
GTAGSLABEL<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>pygments</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, you need to install (or activate) <code>ggtags-mode</code>. If you use spacemacs, you only need to activate the <code>gtags</code> layer.
All this has become moot as soon as <a href="https://scalameta.org/metals/">metals</a> has reached a usable state: now you can have a really fast language server for Scala, written in Scala with low memory overhead.</p><hr/><ul class="pa0">
