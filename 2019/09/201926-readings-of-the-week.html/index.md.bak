A bit of Python, some more Rust and the usual randomness. The first one looks
tasty. <!--more-->

**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links.
Python, Rust, tasty stuff and the usual miscellanea. Expect a similar wide range in
the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag

## [Deconstructing the perfect Patty Melt](https://www.saveur.com/deconstructing-perfect-patty-melt/)
Iâ€™m a big fan of Saveur. Good recipes and pretty good food history writing.
Also, our favorite coffee shop used to have a _patty melt_ sandwich, although it
was chicken. And very good.

## [The simple words that save lives](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190919-the-simple-words-that-save-lives)
Choosing the right words can make all the difference. Just like the concept of
_metaphor building_ mentioned in [Readings of the Week
18](https://mostlymaths.net/2019/06/201918-readings-of-week.html/), having the
right word can make it be (or not) the last word.

## [Face Detection with Actix Web](https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-actix-web/)
A very feature-complete example of using Actix and linking it with a highly
non-trivial system. One of the best technical writings Iâ€™ve read lately!

## [Exploring your data with just 1 line of Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-your-data-with-just-1-line-of-python-4b35ce21a82d)
To be fair, the line is after all importing a package, but the results you can
get from this import show promise. Added to my toolbox.

## [The Church of Interruption](https://sambleckley.com/writing/church-of-interruption.html)
This... was pretty mind blowing. I wasnâ€™t aware, and Iâ€™m not even sure what kind
I am: I nod a lot, and try to keep people explaining stuff... But Iâ€™m also prone
to stopping if I know what they are telling me. I need to be more careful and
find it out.

## [Making a Case: Rust for Python developers](https://medium.com/@rajasekar3eg/making-a-case-rust-for-python-developers-1a114e2d89f4)
Although the example comparison is not fair at all (if you write a custom data
processor in Scala or Python, theyâ€™ll also beat Spark, thatâ€™s not the goal of
Spark) I also think Rust is _a_ future for data processing at high speed.

## [Why The Fugate Family Are Literally "The Blue People Of Kentucky"](https://allthatsinteresting.com/fugate-family-blue-people-of-kentucky)
The world is weirder than you think.

## [Fold in Python](https://www.burgaud.com/foldl-foldr-python)
Iâ€™ve been writing a lot of Python lately, and Iâ€™m always finding myself reaching
for the standard approaches Iâ€™d use in Scala. Maps (the fact that map creates a
map object still baffles me), folds, filters. Hereâ€™s a short post on _fold_ in
Python from a Haskell point of view.

## [ðŸ”Š Empires of EVE](https://www.amazon.com/Empires-EVE-History-Great-Online/dp/0990972402/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=2a9b21f6ff1d47267fee198952544200&language=en_US)
I have always enjoyed reading the stories about EVE online and similar ([did you
know Yannis Varoufakis worked for
Valve?](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/it-all-began-with-a-strange-email/)).
Also, Simon Wardley mentioned recently he would think any EVE online CEO to be a
[very good candidate for real world
manager](https://mobile.twitter.com/swardley/status/1172419432003424256). So in
the end this audiobook was pretty entertaining, although itâ€™s somewhat hard to
follow at times, as an audiobook.

## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS
went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters
Iâ€™m subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your
case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).
