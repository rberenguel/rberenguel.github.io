I have been on quite the hiatus, making this more of a _readings of the month_
edition. Sorry! <!--more--> Last one was published/sent a bit more than a month
ago (and my reading list is now at 347 pending), but there is a reason. The
reason has been a mix of other side stuff taking over and a big project related
to my blog: I have moved (after something like 14 years) from Blogger.com to
hosting it in GitHub pages as a static site (generated with
[hugo](https://gohugo.io)). I‚Äôll write about the process in due time, but the
move required quite a lot of work (tweaking templates, fixing the most visited
and most recent posts..) and I‚Äôm not even done (only 60 out of the 300 or so
posts I have kept out of 700 are optimized for the new layout).

## [Global heating: ancient plants set to reproduce in UK after 60m years](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/global-heating-ancient-plants-set-to-reproduce-in-uk-after-60m-years)
We are doomed.
## [Loops in Python - comparison and performance](https://www.blog.duomly.com/loops-in-python-comparison-and-performance/)
It may not tell anything new to seasoned Pythonistas, but it‚Äôs a good reference
to hand down to people asking.

It‚Äôs not bragging if it‚Äôs true.

me say [Wardley mapping](https://mostlymaths.net/tags/wardley-maps/) before,
right?
## [Scientists Are Discovering Long-Lost Rules for Ancient Board Games](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kz483y/scientists-are-discovering-long-lost-rules-for-ancient-board-games)
This may fix the many rules for _Ludum Latrunculorum_ or decide which is the
best version of the _tablut/tafl_ family.
## [Behind Nate Silver‚Äôs war with The New York Times](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/15/nate-silver-new-york-times-1461666?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits)

## [When and why to use GraphQL](https://medium.com/@JeffLombardJr/when-and-why-to-use-graphql-24f6bce4839d)
I have never dared close to GraphQL, and the when and whys here explain my
fears. So, done rightly is not to fear.
## [Experience: I‚Äôm a world-class whistler](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/09/experience-im-a-world-class-whistler)
And not the referee kind.
## [How to make fresh soba noodles at home](https://www.saveur.com/how-to-make-fresh-soba-noodles-at-home/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email)
I won‚Äôt ever do this, but as a read, fascinating.
## [Functional Programming? Don‚Äôt Even Bother, It‚Äôs a Silly Toy](https://medium.com/@ilyasz/fp-toy-7f52ea0a947e)
Don‚Äôt miss the tone.
## [TDD on Punch Cards](https://medium.com/@DaveSchinkel/tdd-on-punch-cards-f17c25282fa4?postPublishedType=initial)
Well, it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúour‚Äù TDD, but it had T and D.

I need help with this.
## [All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people](https://medium.com/@bellmar/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f)

Worth keeping in mind if I ever get any Haskell written.
## [How to Keep a Zibaldone](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-keep-a-zibaldone-a-13thcentury-answer-to-tumblr)
Just a commonplace book.

Neat!
## üìö [Ultralearning](https://www.amazon.com/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate-ebook/dp/B07K6MF8MD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=ultralearning&qid=1567334582&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=9687789e76a98c2b9f99f85cba878d54&language=en_US)
Techniques for self-learning at a faster pace. Don‚Äôt think I picked any ideas I
was not familiar with, but it‚Äôs a good book.
