Although this week I have been reading mostly Apache Cassandra documentation, I
have tried to avoid an onslaught of tips, tricks and readings on it. Just one
article. <!--more-->

**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links. City
planning, writing, Pythonâ€™s typing, Cassandra. Expect a similar wide range in
the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag

get these as a weekly newsletter by subscribing

## [BLUF: The Military Standard That Can Make Your Writing More Powerful](https://www.animalz.co/blog/bottom-line-up-front/)
A technique to be succinct and clear in communication. Pair it with
five.sentenc.es for maximum punch.

## [ðŸ“º Design Challenges of Bloop by Jorge Vican](https://jvican.github.io/slides/scalaworld-2019/Design-challenges-of-Bloop.pdf)
One of the presentations I enjoyed the most in Scala World 2019 (aside from [Sam
Aaronâ€™s](https://twitter.com/samaaron) presentation on [Sonic
Pi](https://sonic-pi.net))

## [Types for Python HTTP APIs: An Instagram Story](https://instagram-engineering.com/types-for-python-http-apis-an-instagram-story-d3c3a207fdb7)
Instagram is a clear success story on Django. But Pythonâ€™s lack of stronger
static typing is always a thread. This is how they approach the problem

## [Town in Iceland Paints 3D Zebra Crosswalk To Slow Down Speeding Cars](https://www.boredpanda.com/3d-pedestrian-crossing-island/)
I visited StykkyshÃ³lmur (and I had used this city name as secret question
once... Bad idea) many years ago. I recognised the city just from the pictures
in this article. I think this is an excellent idea, and all pedestrian crossings
should be painted this way. Subconsciously, everyone would brake, even knowing
itâ€™s flat.

## [How does a relational database work](http://coding-geek.com/how-databases-work/)
An extremely long and informative article on internals. Only thing missing would
be discussing the Volcano iterator model. Or I didnâ€™t see it there.

## [7 mistakes when using Apache Cassandra](https://blog.softwaremill.com/7-mistakes-when-using-apache-cassandra-51d2cf6df519)
Iâ€™ve read a lot of material about Cassandra this past week, and this is a
standout.

## [The Wheel](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/the-wheel/)
How large teams can handle reporting

## [Learning to build distributed systems](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2019/04/03/learning.html)
Tips and tricks on how to work on big, distributed systems.

## [ðŸ“š Programming Interviews Exposed](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Through-Interview/dp/111941847X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=MMJU1VG9AAE&keywords=programming+interview+exposed&qid=1568471595&sprefix=programming+intervie,aps,221&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=43bf939e0feac3f893340369bc29a723&language=en_US)
I skimmed most of it. Interestingâ€¦ but boring as well. Not sure Iâ€™d recommend
unless you plan on interviewing extensively.

## [ðŸ“šðŸ”ˆ Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Thinking-Book-Mental-Models/dp/0525533583/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=super+thinking&qid=1568471658&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=bee484ed0b171ffa2cb40ce7552ac23f&language=en_US)
I went for the audiobook. This is the extended version of G. Weinbergâ€™s (of
[DuckDuckGo fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo#History)) [post on
mental
models](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d).
It is an excellent book: compares extremely well with Shane Parrishâ€™s one.

## [ðŸ“šðŸ”ˆ Black Box Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Box-Thinking-People-Mistakes-But/dp/1591848229/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=black+box+thinking&qid=1568471704&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=5c340833a41aa77675bcf5aeaf56c032&language=en_US)
Wavy. Some parts were extremely interesting (especially the beliefs/mind
changing part), others were pretty much average of worse. But, Iâ€™m not sure if
it is because Iâ€™m already familiar with the material.

## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS
went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters
Iâ€™m subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your
case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).
