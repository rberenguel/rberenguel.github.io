If you've been in this blog before, you may wonder if it looks different or is
just your imagination. Fear not! You are not going crazy, this blag _has_
changed. <!--more--> 

After something like 14 years using Blogger as a hosting platform, I have moved
to hosting `mostlymaths.net` in Github pages, using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) as
a static site generator.

### Some details

- I used a converter offered in Hugo's webpage, that could convert from Blogger
  export XML to Markdown for hugo
- I settled on a customised [Ananke
  theme](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke/tree/master/exampleSite/content/post).
  It's a fully featured theme, and Hugo's templating is easy to pick up
- I just had to change some DNS settings and have patience after this

### Pain points

- I had 700+ blog posts. After a hardcore culling, I have around 290. Still,
  markdown needs cleanup, images need to be moved from Blogger to Github…
  There's still a lot left (I have converted around 90 posts, the most popular
  or new)
- It was time consuming, since I had to get many things right ASAP
  (RSS, Google Analytics, bring back some of the Amazon ads, layout, design,
  etc)

### Non-pain points

- Hugo's templating is easy to follow. It was a relative breeze to make it
  look like it looks now
- Search was built using [this
  Gist](https://gist.github.com/eddiewebb/735feb48f50f0ddd65ae5606a1cb41ae) and
  [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io) It works awesomely well

### Niceties

- Having left Blogger means I can now add whatever crazy ~shit~ Javascript or CSS I want:
    - I have a [minimap](https://larsjung.de/pagemap/) in [long
      posts](https://mostlymaths.net/2019/07/a-section-of-map-of-data-engineering.html/)
      (hover around the left area, although that blog post is _so_ long it makes
      the minimap cut off)
    - Dropcaps from [Byrne's Euclid by Nicholas Reougeux ](https://www.c82.net/euclid/about/)
    - MathJax [where needed](https://mostlymaths.net/2014/01/the-mandelbrot-set-in-one-line-of-apl.html/)
    - Haven't yet, but now I will be able to have fun again with D3.js and post my examples _directly_
- Having standalone static pages is now also easier. So far, there are none, but hey
- Writing Markdown is ❤️

### Conclusion

- I should have done this a year ago, at least. It's so much easier to handle now
