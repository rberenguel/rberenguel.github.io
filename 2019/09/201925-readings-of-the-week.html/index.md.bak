Heavy focus on Python's `asyncio` this week. Also, one of the best books of the
year. <!--more-->

**NOTE**: This week you'll have async, cooking, software architecture. Expect a
similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings

## [A History of BÃ¶rek](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/history-borek)
Tasty and interesting.

## [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)
This week I got up to date with Pythonâ€™s asyncio. Start with this one

## [Asyncio exception handling](https://www.roguelynn.com/words/asyncio-exception-handling/)
Then, discover how to properly handle errors

## [Asyncio graceful shutdown](https://www.roguelynn.com/words/asyncio-graceful-shutdowns/)
And how to process keyboard/kill shutdowns like a boss.

## [Doom Emacs Workflows](https://noelwelsh.com/posts/2019-01-10-doom-emacs.html)
Iâ€™ve been a Spacemacs user for a long while, but I know happy people using Doom.
Knowing what they use is always interesting.

## [Documenting Architecture Decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
_Note: this webpage seems unusually slow, but it will eventually load_. I learnt of this technique by [Michael Nygard](https://twitter.com/mtnygard) (of
[Release
it!](https://www.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software-ebook/dp/B079YWMY2V/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=release+it&qid=1569179754&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=0a89f3fb6c2f819723e4d1637b3d56fa)
fame) a long time ago (even before [ThoughtWorks
approved](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records))
and applied it sparingly. Have been using it hardly lately, and itâ€™s good in the
short term, letâ€™s see how it fares with time.

## [Comments on a Very Effective Communications System: Marshall Space Flight Centerâ€™s Monday Notes](https://launiusr.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/comments-on-a-very-effective-communications-system-marshall-space-flight-center%E2%80%99s-monday-notes/)
Communication across teams is hard. Wernher von Braun had a system at NASA, and
its breakage may have been linked with later failures. But thatâ€™s not important,
the important part is how you could apply something similar in your
organisation.

## [ðŸ“š Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=range&qid=1569179504&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=0ad08ac279ee385965b868347f730ee8)

As a generalist, this has been such an encouraging read. Also, the choice and
point of view of the example stories (even if I had already read them elsewhere)
was much better than any other book. Highly recommended.

## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS
went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters
Iâ€™m subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your
case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).
