[Fermentation and Daily Life](https://www.notechmagazine.com/2018/07/fermentation-and-daily-life.html)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm not a fan of fermented food, but my girlfriend is. The article is interesting even for me.

[Why Are Young People Pretending to Love Work?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ‚Äúgrind and hustle‚Äù gets old pretty quick.

[üìö Specifying Systems](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

_The book_ for learning TLA+ (and, free to download from the link above). I‚Äôm reading it right now, step by step. You can also get a paperback version from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Specifying-Systems-Language-Hardware-Engineers/dp/032114306X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1548615553&sr=8-2&keywords=practical+tla+&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=b28c49dcc2aab1732af9966f8d9708e0) (affiliate link) but it's kind of expensive.

[The Perils and Pleasures of Bartending in Antarctica](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/bartender-antarctica-south-pole)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It kind of makes sense.

[‚ÄúO Uommibatto‚Äù: How the Pre-Raphaelites Became Obsessed with the Wombat](https://publicdomainreview.org/2019/01/10/how-the-pre-raphaelites-became-obsessed-with-the-wombat/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Why Don‚Äôt People Use Formal Methods?](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/why-dont-people-use-formal-methods/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you may have realized, I‚Äôm interested in formal methods and verification. I‚Äôm not the only one, and since I now pay more attention to articles on the subject, I find more articles to share. Hillel is the author of [Practical TLA+](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-TLA-Planning-Driven-Development/dp/1484238281/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1548615491&sr=8-1&keywords=practical+tla+&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=9da563f0c274543c113482957c9c57c7) (affiliate link), the book that finally got me to write specs.

[The 1859 Carrington Event](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/22/the-1859-carrington-event/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea of this happening ‚Äúnow‚Äù is actually scary.

[Ask HN: What are your ‚Äúbrain hacks‚Äù that help you manage everyday situations?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18588727)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may pick up one or two tricks that can be useful.

[What if the Placebo Effect Isn‚Äôt a Trick?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/magazine/placebo-effect-medicine.html)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, take this sugar pill. You‚Äôll be cured.

[Kafka at Criteo](https://www.slideshare.net/RicardoPaiva17/how-criteo-is-managing-one-of-the-largest-kafka-infrastructure-in-europe)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Slides from Slideshare. The scale is astounding. Note that the [engineering blog at Criteo](http://labs.criteo.com/engineering-blog/) is top notch, but your adblocker is probably going to give you a hard time reading it.

[When Rust is safer than Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/when-rust-is-safer-than-haskell)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm closer to doing useful stuff in Rust than in Haskell, so it‚Äôs always good to know Rust has some nice tricks up its sleeve.

[Inductive invariants](https://lorinhochstein.wordpress.com/2018/12/27/inductive-invariants/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More TLA+ goodness, from Lorin Hochstein.

[Spark Barcelona Meetup: Speeding up PySpark with Arrow](https://www.meetup.com/Spark-Barcelona/events/258139339/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Thursday I‚Äôm speaking about how PySpark got faster by using Arrow internally. If you are around Barcelona please join us! Note that the slides for this talk are not up yet!

[üìö Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics by Dan Harris](https://www.amazon.com/Meditation-for-Fidgety-Skeptics/dp/B07CNR397V/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1548614747&sr=8-3&keywords=meditation+for+fidgety+skeptics+by+dan+harris&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=ca507dfaed37d3bcc9edc89b46c44d9d)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(note there are affiliate links in here) This is the follow-up to [10% Happier](https://www.amazon.com/10-Happier-Reduced-Self-Help-Actually/dp/B077TYZQMQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1548614747&sr=8-4&keywords=meditation+for+fidgety+skeptics+by+dan+harris&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=97fabcca3dc51c2d5d7e0c2e773d187e). MfFS is good, offering a more practical take than the previous one. As books to stand on its own, [10% Happier](https://www.amazon.com/10-Happier-Reduced-Self-Help-Actually/dp/B077TYZQMQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1548614747&sr=8-4&keywords=meditation+for+fidgety+skeptics+by+dan+harris&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=97fabcca3dc51c2d5d7e0c2e773d187e) is better though.

[üìΩ 10 tips for failing badly at microservices](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X0tjziAQfNQ)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very fun talk about what you should do if you want to prevent (in an ironic way) your company from moving to a microservices-based architecture. You may get flashbacks to the [Simple Sabotage Field Manual](https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2012-featured-story-archive/CleanedUOSSSimpleSabotage_sm.pdf) from the CIA.

[Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
---------------------------------------

I‚Äôm considering converting this into a weekly newsletter in addition to a blog post. These days (since RSS went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters I‚Äôm subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P) and if enough people join I‚Äôll send these every Sunday night or so.
