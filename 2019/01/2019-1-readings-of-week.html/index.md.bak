If you know me, you'll know I have a quite extensive reading list. I keep it in [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), and is part of my to do stored in [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/). It used to be _large_ (hovering around 230 items since August) but during Christmas it got out of control, reaching almost 300 items. <!--more--> That was too much, and I set myself a goal for 2019 to keep it trimmed and sweet. And indeed, since the beginning of the year I have read or canceled 171 articles (122 in the past week, 106 of which were read). That's a decently sized book!



To help me in this goal, I'll (or at least I hope) be writing a weekly post about what interesting stuff I have read the past week. Beware, this week may be a bit larger than usual, since I wanted to bring the numbers down as fast as possible.
**NOTE**: The themes are varied. Software/data engineering, drawing, writing. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well.

### [The Nature of Infinity, and Beyond – Cantor’s Paradise](https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-nature-of-infinity-and-beyond-a05c146df02c)

A short tour through the life of Georg Cantor and his quest for proving the continuum hypothesis. In the end, he was vindicated.

### [Statistical rule of three](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/30/statistical-rule-of-three/)

What is a decent estimate of something that hasn't happened yet? Find the answer here.

### [Apache Arrow: use of jemalloc](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2018/07/20/jemalloc/)

A short technical post detailing why Arrow moved to jemalloc for memory allocation.

### [Subpixel Text Encoding](http://www.msarnoff.org/millitext/)

This is... unexpected. A font that is 1 pixel wide.

### [Solving murder with Prolog](https://xmonader.github.io/prolog/2018/12/21/solving-murder-prolog.html)

I have always been a fan of Prolog, and this is a fun and understandable example if you have never used it.

### [What Parkour Classes Teach Older People About Falling](https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/12/parkour-class-50-plus-aging-fall-prevention-exercise/577900/)

Interesting. I'm still young, but I'll keep this in mind for the future.

### [Implementing VisiCalc](http://rmf.vc/implementingvisicalc)

The detailed story about how VisiCalc (the first spreadsheet) was written.

### [The military secret to falling asleep in two minutes](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fall-asleep-two-minutes-how-to-military-secret-trick-a8520991.html)

I was actually doing something similar since I was like 12. It might be a stretch to say 2 minutes, but works.

### [Index 1,600,000,000 Keys with Automata and Rust](https://blog.burntsushi.net/transducers/)

Super interesting (and long) post about how FSA and FST are used for fast search in Rust (I'm a bit into Rust lately). Also, BurntSushi's (Andrew Gallant, the author) cat is called Cauchy, something I appreciate as my cat is named Fatou.

### [How to Draw from Imagination: Beyond References](https://www.sketchbook.com/blog/how-to-draw-imagination-using-references/)

An excellent piece on gesture drawing and improving your technique.

### [Anatomy of a Scala quirk](https://blog.buildo.io/anatomy-of-a-scala-quirk-b8c086b56423)

All languages have their WAT, it's harder to find them in Scala though.

### [Chaotic attractor reconstruction](http://node99.org/tutorials/ar/)

An easy example in Python of Takens' embedding theorem

### [Hello, declarative world](https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world)

An exploration between imperative and functional, and how declarative fits the landscape

### [Python with Context Managers](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/)

Although I have written tons of Python, I never took the time to either write or understand how context managers work. This one was good.

### [Raymond Chandler's Ten Commandments For the Detective Novel](http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/triv116.html)

You never know when you may write a detective novel. _Ruben and the case of the dead executor_

### [Seven steps to 100x faster](https://syslog.ravelin.com/making-something-faster-56dd6b772b83)

An optimisation tour of a piece of code written in Go, from data structures to allocation pressure.

### [Writing a Faster Jsonnet Compiler](https://databricks.com/blog/2018/10/12/writing-a-faster-jsonnet-compiler.html)

A semi-technical post by Databricks about Jsonnet and why they wrote their own compiler. Serves as an introduction to Jsonnet ("compilable JSON") as well.

### Bonus

[Monoid](https://larsenwork.com/monoid/) font and [Poet emacs theme](https://github.com/kunalb/poet)

Today I switched from solarized dark and Fira Code Pro to the above. It looks interesting

[Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
---------------------------------------

I’m considering converting this into a weekly newsletter in addition to a blog post. These days (since RSS went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters I’m subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog. If this is also your case, subscribe by clicking [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P) and if enough people join I’ll send these every Sunday night or so.
