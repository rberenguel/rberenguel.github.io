[Finding Lena Forsen, the Patron Saint of JPEGs](https://www.wired.com/story/finding-lena-the-patron-saint-of-jpegs/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have written about Lena Forsen (previously Soderberg) [before](https://www.mostlymaths.net/2009/12/image-processing-history-lena.html). This is an article explaining the story behind the classic picture, the issues that have arisen with it after the years and a bit of the take of the subject, Lena.

[Incrementally migrating over one million lines of code from Python 2 to Python 3](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/02/incrementally-migrating-over-one-million-lines-of-code-from-python-2-to-python-3/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you know, Dropbox (the client) is written in Python? Well, I did, but wasn't aware of its scale. And, now it's mostly Python 3, which is good to know. Bonus points for Dropbox for using `pytest` as well.

[How Criteo is trying to navigate GDPR](https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/how-criteo-is-trying-to-navigate-gdpr/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since I work in adtech, I need to keep up with what's up and how everything is going. This article explains a bit the impact of GDPR on Criteo, one of the largest players in programmatic advertising in Europe. By the way, Criteo have a [superb engineering blog](http://labs.criteo.com/engineering-blog/), although it can be a bit hard to read through an adblocker. By the way, the linked post is behind a paywall. Paste the URL of the link on Google and click on the first search result to be able to read it if interested.

[10 Reasons Why GTD Might Be Failing](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/why-gtd-fails)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The title of the linked article should end in _for you_. It lists the common problems a GTD newbie-intermediate can face. Been there, done that. Still am, probably.

[Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion Dollar Company](https://medium.com/@shl/reflecting-on-my-failure-to-build-a-billion-dollar-company-b0c31d7db0e7)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The story of GumRoad, the publishing site. A very interesting view on startups.

[StranglerApplication](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of Martin Fowler's refactoring approaches. I'm pretty sure you've done this, turns out it has a name.

[The de Havilland Comet](http://www.greatdisasters.co.uk/the-de-havilland-comet/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The story of the first passenger jet disasters, and why they happened.

[Simple dependent types in Python](https://sobolevn.me/2019/01/simple-dependent-types-in-python)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They may be a bit too simple for what you may be looking for, but the potential is there. Also, linked to the following, which I found ideal.

[1-minute guide to real constants in Python](https://sobolevn.me/2018/07/real-python-contants)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's actually a `Final` type coming, someday, to Python, which will make constants real constants. Looking forward to that.

[The Dunning-Kruger effect, and how to fight it](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/31/18200497/dunning-kruger-effect-explained-trump)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a quote in this interview of David Dunning which is _just_ brilliant:

> The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. People miss that.‚Äù

üìö[Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Changes-Remarkable-Results/dp/B07GBGB7SY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1550425942&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=cb8258cc865acbe966efb5ff999f1b8a)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week I have finished [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Changes-Remarkable-Results/dp/B07GBGB7SY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1550425942&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=cb8258cc865acbe966efb5ff999f1b8a) (affiliate link). I didn't expect much, after having read so many productivity books during my life. And indeed, there was _nothing new_ I hadn't read before, but the presentation, examples and overall feel of the book have been excellent, I have rated it 5 stars in Goodreads, which is not something I do frequently (once per year, approximately).
