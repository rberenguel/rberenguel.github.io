[Playing with Rust](https://perevillega.com/playing-with-rust)
--------------------------------------------------------------

I've known Pere for several years, and I'm glad to see his views on Rust. Looks like not every Scala developer has to move from Scala to Haskell.

[Try out walrus operator in Python 3.8](https://medium.com/hultner/try-out-walrus-operator-in-python-3-8-d030ce0ce601)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_I am the egg man, they are the egg men, I am the PEP 572: Goo goo g'joob_. Well, or not. This feels very un-pythonic, and we all know the amount of flak BDFL got for that. But oh well, it's in Python 3.8-dev. Let this serve as the weekly reminder that [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is excellent.

[Cognitive Journaling: A Systematic Method to Overcome Negative Beliefs](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-journaling-a-systematic-method-to-overcome-negative-beliefs-119be459842c)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year I had been journaling on and off, and this year I have been consistent, every day so far since New Year. This has interesting approaches to understand your mind better.

[How Jeff Bezos Turned Narrative into Amazon's Competitive Advantage](https://slab.com/blog/jeff-bezos-writing-management-strategy)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This idea is gold, but the [HackerNews comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19115686) are better than the original article.

[Model Metropolis](https://logicmag.io/06-model-metropolis/)
------------------------------------------------------------

I read about Forrester's [Urban Dynamics](https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Dynamics-Jay-Wright-Forrester/dp/0262060264/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=forrester+urban+dynamics&qid=1549830974&s=gateway&sr=8-1-fkmrnull&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=5da390ef8c08e724d1f989d97c94afa7) in the excellent [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-in-Systems-A-Primer/dp/B07FW9Z4KG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=meadows+systems+thinking&qid=1549831040&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=209b94245ac5ee9b2edcf2df48abff48) from Donella Meadows. And this also talks about SimCity, what else could I want?

[A Humility Training Exercise for Technical Interviewers](https://triplebyte.com/blog/a-humility-training-exercise-for-technical-interviewers)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea presented here is powerful: learn to remove biases from your interviews. As an occasional interviewer (and interviewee), I can totally see how this can help.

[pandas blog – Pandas Extension Arrays](https://pandas-dev.github.io/pandas-blog/pandas-extension-arrays.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extension arrays show a lot of promise, and right now there is work underway for Pandas extension arrays based on Arrow ([fletcher](https://github.com/xhochy/fletcher)). Although the cool work will happen when the underlying memory layout and building blocks of Pandas are actually Arrow... And that is underway as well.

[Demystifying JOIN Algorithms](http://blog.felipe.rs/2019/01/29/demystifying-join-algorithms/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very good explanation of basic join algorithms, with a pseudocode that looks pretty much like Python
