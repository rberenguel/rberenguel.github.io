[Hacking the Casio F-91W to Handle 1000+ PSI](https://dvt.name/2019/06/03/hacking-the-casio-f-91w-to-handle-1000-psi/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was an amusing find. I wonder where my F-91 is.

[The Day You Became a Better Writer (2nd Look)](https://blog.dilbert.com/2015/08/22/the-day-you-became-a-better-writer-2nd-look/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Top notch, short and sweet writing tips by Scott Adams (of Dilbert fame)

[Rebuffing the Attack of the Clones](https://thenewwazoo.github.io/clone.html)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iâ€™m guilty of unnecessary cloning. Shame, shame.

[Generating geometric image placeholders client-side](https://decentium.org/x/almstdigital/generating-ge)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neat! I had written something similar in C [a long time ago](https://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/04/approximating-images-with-randomly.html). It was slow! This is blazingly fast.

[Behavioral Ad Targeting Not Paying Off for Publishers, Study Suggests](https://www.wsj.com/articles/behavioral-ad-targeting-not-paying-off-for-publishers-study-suggests-11559167195)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is surprising. Iâ€™d expect CPM to be higher for high value programmatically bid users.

[The Embroiderer's Story: Hand Skills](http://thistle-threads.blogspot.com/2019/05/hand-skills-doctors-of-sewing-needed.html)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An unexpected consequence of the digitalisation of our leisure

[No frills data warehousing with dbt](http://tamaszilagyi.com/blog/2019/2019-03-05-dbt/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iâ€™ve been considering this tool (the open source one, not the cloud offering, I have Airflow for that) for a while.

[Why I'm Stepping Back from Scalaz (John De Goes)](http://degoes.net/articles/zio-solo)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very well reasoned writing. Iâ€™m all for ZIO.

[Apache Flink: Flux capacitor, huh? Temporal Tables and Joins in Streaming SQL](https://flink.apache.org/2019/05/14/temporal-tables.html)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I donâ€™t use Flink, but itâ€™s there, staring at me.

[Using Poetry in production](https://bmwlog.pp.ua/post/using-poetry-in-production)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It sounds powerful in combination with my dear [pyenv](https://www.github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

[How I run a company with ADHD](https://www.andrewaskins.com/how-i-run-a-company-with-adhd/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I somehow can relate, I wonder why OH HEY A SQUIRREL

[CQL: A categorical query language](https://www.categoricaldata.net/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The categorical hype rises. Iâ€™d like to see scheme-based data analysis at some point (that could be a thing at some point, schemes as in generalized algebraic manifolds)

[ðŸ“š Baking with Kafka](https://www.amazon.com/Baking-Kafka-Tom-Gauld/dp/1770462961/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=291411f7971e475e08fbf060b1ddb007)

An amusing book by cartoonist Tom Gauld.

[ðŸŽ¥ Crossing the River by Feeing the Stones](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13456-keynote-simon-wardley)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been doing Wardley maps for close to a month, and they have been really influential in how I approach a lot of things. I will be giving a short introduction to them this weekend at [SoCraTesUK 2019](http://socratesuk.org/), if you are there say hello (and I'll post the slides soon)

[AWKrdeck: Deckset to Reveal.js](https://github.com/rberenguel/awkrdeck)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote a simple converter from [Deckset](http://deckset.com/) style presentations to similarly-themed [Reveal.js](http://revealjs.com/) presentations using some AWK and Pandoc.
