[Meet the Money Whisperer to the Super-Rich N.B.A. Elite](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/business/nba-wealth-manager-klay-thompson-joe-mclean.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It surely has to be an interesting job

[Thought as a Technology](http://cognitivemedium.com/tat/index.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

An essay by Michael Nielsen. Very recommended.

[A tale of lost WW2 uranium cubes shows why Germanyâ€™s nuclear program failed](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/physicists-hunt-uranium-cubes-to-shed-light-on-germanys-failed-nuclear-reactor/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Curio

[Counting to infinity at compile time â€“ The Startup â€“ Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/counting-to-infinity-at-compile-time-2bbdd6446329)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can do really weird things with Scala at compile time, and [base 3 is pretty cool](http://bit-player.org/wp-content/extras/bph-publications/AmSci-2001-11-Hayes-ternary.pdf).

[A visual introduction to Morse theory](http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/morse_theory/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was surprised to see this posted on Hacker News, so decided to read it for the "good old times". Learnt something (since I never had a class on Morse theory, it was just one of those intriguing sections in the library)

[The cutting-edge of cutting: How Japanese scissors have evolved](https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Life/The-cutting-edge-of-cutting-How-Japanese-scissors-have-evolved2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have some weird scissors, but these go beyond weird.

[A different kind of string theory: Antoni Gaudi](https://memetician.livejournal.com/201202.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That idea was clearly genius.

[Formally Specifying a Package Manager](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/nix/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By using [Alloy](http://alloytools.org/). I really like Alloy.

[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was talking with a friend earlier about a previous post in my Weekly Readings series ([Do I truly want to become a manager?](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/03/20/do-i-truly-want-to-become-a-manager/)) and he hadn't read this one, so I'll share it here too.

[Schema evolution in Avro, Protocol Buffers and Thrift](http://martin.kleppmann.com/2012/12/05/schema-evolution-in-avro-protocol-buffers-thrift.html)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I kind of like the sound of how Avro handles schemas. Seems an efficient way, although seems... prone to possible disasters.

[Improve Apache Spark write performance on Apache Parquet formats with the EMRFS S3-optimized committer](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/improve-apache-spark-write-performance-on-apache-parquet-formats-with-the-emrfs-s3-optimized-committer/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is optional in EMR 5.19 and will be the default in 5.20 so we won't see much difference, except in performance.

[Why Enthusiasm is a Bad Thing in a CTO](https://cutebouncingbunnies.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/why-enthusiasm-is-a-bad-thing-in-a-cto/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, look a squirrel is 10x more dangerous when it's the CTO spotting squirrels.

[ðŸ–¥ Mapping as a Tool for Thought](https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A presentation I gave on Wardley mapping and "mapping" in general at [SoCraTesUK 2019](http://socratesuk.org/). I really enjoy this conference.

[ðŸŽ¥ Skip the first three months of development for your next app](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=deHM34b21v4)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ties very well with some of the Wardley mapping concepts.
