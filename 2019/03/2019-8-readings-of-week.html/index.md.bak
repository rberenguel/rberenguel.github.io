[Messaging startup Slack is secretly an acronym for...](https://qz.com/794524/messaging-startup-slack-is-secretly-an-acronym-for-searchable-log-of-all-communication-and-knowledge/)

No spoilers, you'll need to click. It _may_ or _may not_ surprise you

[Beautiful, Simple, Testable Functional Effects for Scala](http://degoes.net/articles/zio-environment)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next thing I write in a functional style in Scala, it will be using [Zio](https://scalaz.github.io/scalaz-zio/) for sure. This was a follow-up to a talk given at [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13247-scala-matters), and shortly followed by a podcast interview in [Scala Love](https://scala.love/effectful-episode-with-john-de-goes/). Haven't watched the talk yet, but the podcast was good.

[Apple highlights best photos shot on iPhone around the world](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/02/apple-highlights-best-photos-shot-on-iphone-around-the-world/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They look good. And that may be an understatement.

[Formally Specifying UIs](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/formally-specifying-uis/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've been following my readings of the week you'll know I've been converted into a fan of formal methods. And [alloy](http://alloytools.org/) is pretty cool.

[Building the Hangman Game using ZIO](https://abhsrivastava.github.io/2018/11/03/Hangman-Game-Using-ZIO/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An approachable example (in addition to the details in the post above by John himself) based in a talk [John](http://twitter.com/jdegoes) gave, detailed by Abhishek Srivastava.

[Revolut insiders reveal the human cost of a fintech unicorn's wild rise](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/revolut-trade-unions-labour-fintech-politics-storonsky)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week the CFO of Revolut resigned his position, after (possibly) an investigation about fraud. That was an amber flag, but reading how Revolut's CEO treats employees... As a worker in the same space (tech) that's a red. I had been using Revolut for more than a year (before I used Monzo) and I'll be using [N26](https://n26.com/r/rubenb2889) as soon as I get my card. By enrolling by the [N26](https://n26.com/r/rubenb2889) link here I think I get some kind of affiliate return, I'm not sure.

[The hard part in becoming a command line wizard](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/02/18/command-line-wizard/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the end, it's the hard part in becoming a wizard in anything. Math, programming, playing the ukulele.

[Casperâ€™s clever little nightlight](https://blog.bolt.io/casper-glow-e4f8819376d7)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't read many hardware breakdowns, but somehow I clicked on this one and now I want one of these nightlights.

[ðŸ“š The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human](https://www.amazon.com/Storytelling-Animal-Stories-Make-Human/dp/0544002342/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1EML1L792VSX5&keywords=storytelling+animal&qid=1551729721&s=gateway&sprefix=storytelling+animal,aps,243&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=1b49440451004950dfae11397a519ea9)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was attracted to the premise of this book, but it felt pretty underwhelming. It has pretty high reviews, so it may have been just me.

[Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?

These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters Iâ€™m subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog.
