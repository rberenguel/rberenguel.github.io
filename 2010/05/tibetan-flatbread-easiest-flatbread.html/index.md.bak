I bet you have felt like this some day: You just prepared a soup, one of those
soups in need of crumbs of bread. Or you prepared a nice meal, asking for bread
to dump in the sauce. And you have no bread at home! Not a single piece of
bread.

This is the answer

This bread, soft in the inside, slightly crispy in the outside and chewy, only
takes 20 minutes from taking ingredients out of the cupboards until breaking it
into pieces with your hands.

What you will need:

* 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking power
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (add a little more if you want it saltier)
* 1 cup water
* 2 tablespoon water
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* add your preferred spices here (curry, thymeâ€¦)

That's all. Preparing it is a breeze: mix the flour, baking powder and salt,
then add the cup of water and mix thoroughly. Take out a cold pan (it has to be
a cold pan) of around 20 cm wide (around 9 inches) and spread the olive oil in
it. Pour the dough and put the two tablespoons of water around the edges of the
dough. Close the pan with a tight lid and turn on the fire on medium-high. Wait
for 10 minutes and flip over. Cook for 5 more minutes, and you are done.
