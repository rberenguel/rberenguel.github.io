    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l justify "><p>Last saturday I was in a porting mood, and tackled two interesting packages to have in the <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/03/unpacking-my-ben-nanonote.html">Ben NanoNote</a>: yacas and 4th.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacas">Yacas</a> (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a very interesting application to have in such a small device. The best calculator I have used is my old faithful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hp49g#HP_49G">HP49g</a>. But in these days, it is bulky, heavy and slow. It was superseded by <a href="http://www.mksg.de/m48/m48.html">m48</a> (a HP48+ emulator) inside my iPod Touch. Quite nice: the HP48 is programmable, has graphing capabilities and quite a good computer algebra system.</p>

<p>However, the NanoNote is a computer. It has a fully featured (fully as in you can put whatever you want in it, if you are able to do so) operating system, and as such, can hold far more than a pocket calculator. And it has a real keyboard, not a fake touch keyboard as in the iTouch or a (horrible) plastic keyboard like the HP49g.</p>

<p>It turned out to be easier than I expected. The process needs a previous step, like <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/04/my-first-port-to-ben-nanonote-gnugo.html">Gnugo</a> did. You have to compile it in your host system, and then use an intermediately generated file to cross-compile. I am almost done in writing a completely automatic Makefile that handles everything for you. As it stands, it is quite messy moving files around, but the program is usable.</p>

<p>The other, <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/project/4tH/">4th</a> is a multi-platform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29">Forth</a> interpreter and compiler. My first try of porting a Forth system was <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/">gforth</a>, but it didn&rsquo;t work: gforth compiles itself (more or less), and in a cross-compilation process this is really hard to handle. The developers even acknowledge it in the INSTALL file.</p>

<p>Fortunately, 4th is easy to cross-compile on purpose and indeed, it worked like a charm. I didn&rsquo;t need to do anything more than write the Makefile and copying the libraries to the Nano afterwards. I&rsquo;m also halfway writing a decent Makefile that copies these libraries where 4th can find them in the Nano.</p>
