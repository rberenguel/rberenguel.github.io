I don&rsquo;t want anyone to come later at me and say they were tricked into buying the book and then realising it was available for free! Anyway, I won&rsquo;t get rich quickly (probably not even slowly) by these sales, but they will work the normal upkeep of this blog.</em></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I realised that I didn&rsquo;t have a printed copy of <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9780762415984/The-Art-of-War/?a_aid=mostlymathsdotnet">Sun Tzu&rsquo;s Art of War</a>, and this thought collided head on with another old thought I had: <em>could I use pdfpages to create A6 booklets?</em> I use it very frequently to turn my papers into handy A4 booklets (a few A4 folded in half), but <strong>I did not know if I could do it another time to generate A5 booklets, or even another time to get a small and nice A6 booklet.</strong></p>

<p>As these two thoughts collided, I decided that the best way to check was to use as base PDF <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9780762415984/The-Art-of-War/?a_aid=mostlymathsdotnet">The Art of War</a>, a book available through <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/132">The Project Gutenberg</a>. I formatted it as a LaTeX ebook with custom sizes (to get readable fonts) and compiled using the fantastic and powerful memoir class. I&rsquo;ll give the details of how to create ebooks with LaTeX later this year or in the beginning of the next. I also did the same to Arnold Bennett&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9781600960741/How-to-Live-on-24-Hours-a-Day/?a_aid=mostlymathsdotnet">How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In my next post I&rsquo;ll give you links to the ebooks and A6 and A7 booklet version of <em>The Art of War</em> and <em>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</em> as a gift for being a reader</strong>. For now, I&rsquo;ll show how to create them from any raw PDF and the steps to build the booklet.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need three TeX files, based on the one I already used in <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2008/09/latex-booklets.html">How to Create LaTeX Booklets</a>. You can refer to that page if there is something missing in here. These files will turn the PDF successively into 2-pages per sheet to 4-pages per sheet to the final 8-pages per sheet printable booklet.</p>

<p>I named the files Booklet2x1.tex, Booklet4x1.tex and Booklet8x1.tex for pretty obvious reasons. Their contents are:</p>

<p><strong>Booklet2x1.tex:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\documentclass[a5paper]{article}</p>

<p>\usepackage[pdftex]{color,graphicx,epsfig}</p>

<p>\usepackage[left=2cm,top=2.cm,bottom=2.cm,right=2cm]{geometry}</p>

<p>\usepackage[final]{pdfpages}</p>

<p>\begin{document}</p>

<p>\includepdf[pages=-, signature=80,landscape, frame=true]{Wrapper.pdf}</p>

<p>\end{document}</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Booklet4x1.tex</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\documentclass[a5paper]{article}</p>

<p>\usepackage[pdftex]{color,graphicx,epsfig}</p>

<p>\usepackage[left=2cm,top=2.cm,bottom=2.cm,right=2cm]{geometry}</p>

<p>\usepackage[final]{pdfpages}</p>

<p>\begin{document}</p>

<p>\includepdf[pages=-, signature=40,landscape, frame=true]{Booklet2x1.pdf}</p>

<p>\end{document}</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Booklet8x1.tex</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>\documentclass[a5paper]{article}</p>

<p>\usepackage[pdftex]{color,graphicx,epsfig}</p>

<p>\usepackage[left=2cm,top=2.cm,bottom=2.cm,right=2cm]{geometry}</p>

<p>\usepackage[final]{pdfpages}</p>

<p>\begin{document}</p>

<p>\includepdf[pages=-, signature=20,landscape, frame=true]{Booklet4x1.pdf}</p>

<p>\end{document}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later I realised that I did not need a5paper in the class part. As I explained in <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2008/09/latex-booklets.html">How to Create LaTeX Booklets</a>, the signature is the number of pages per fold: in the case of a booklet, you have to aim for the closest multiple of 4 from above to the number of pages of the PDF file. In this case, I was lucky: the original file had 80 pages, that turned into 40 and then into 20 (resulting in just 10 pages to print).</p>

<p>The building can get a little tricky, because you need to cut correctly the booklet. That is why I used the frame=true option of pdfpages, this draws a thin line around the pages for a very easy cutting process!</p>

<p>Start by compiling the first tex file with pdflatex, and follow with the other files until you have Booklet8x1.pdf and print it two sided.</p>

<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2QrJYllI/AAAAAAAACug/XdBBqBhJIfI/s1600/A6Booklet1.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2QrJYllI/AAAAAAAACug/XdBBqBhJIfI/s400/A6Booklet1.JPG" alt="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" title="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" /></a></p>

<p>You start with a bunch of pages resulting from the TeX files above</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2QxEqRaI/AAAAAAAACuo/jCS3_rw7JV4/s1600/A6Booklet2.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2QxEqRaI/AAAAAAAACuo/jCS3_rw7JV4/s400/A6Booklet2.JPG" alt="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" title="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" /></a></p>

<p>Cut in half to get a few A5 pieces.</p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2TxU0BMI/AAAAAAAACuw/pf2y37DFHp8/s1600/A6Booklet3.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2TxU0BMI/AAAAAAAACuw/pf2y37DFHp8/s400/A6Booklet3.JPG" alt="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" title="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" /></a></p>

<p>And repeat to get A6 slices. Beware! You have to cut to have an A6 booklet consisting of A7 pages, not separate A7 pages!</p>

<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2UmfUcJI/AAAAAAAACu4/zQ8ioX2t2jw/s1600/A6Booklet4.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2UmfUcJI/AAAAAAAACu4/zQ8ioX2t2jw/s400/A6Booklet4.JPG" alt="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" title="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" /></a></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll end with a bunch of small groups of 2 pages (4 pages per sheet). Pile them in a way that the numbers are consecutive. Keep in mind that you will be folding in half, thus on the left you will have page 2 and the right side you will have page 79. On top of this you need to have page 3 and page 78 (covering pages 2 and 79), and so on. If you don&rsquo;t get it know, you&rsquo;ll understand it once you have the pages in front of you, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2dl-hVaI/AAAAAAAACvI/UVJJaZJNM_A/s1600/A6Booklet6.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2dl-hVaI/AAAAAAAACvI/UVJJaZJNM_A/s400/A6Booklet6.JPG" alt="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" title="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have them neatly folded in half and piled, place them over a soft cloth and staple them along the spine. I usually get by with 2 staples, but feel free to go with one or add a third or fourth.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2VI3tVVI/AAAAAAAACvA/og5TywpRBAk/s1600/A6Booklet5.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/TOL2VI3tVVI/AAAAAAAACvA/og5TywpRBAk/s400/A6Booklet5.JPG" alt="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" title="How to create A6 and A7 booklets" /></a></p>

<p>You are done! Enjoy your pocket reading. If you wish, you can cover in plastic the booklet, it will last longer.</p>

<p>I hope you found this useful. Stay tuned as I will make freely available the pdf files for <em>The Art of War</em> and <em>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</em> as pdf ebooks and as printable A6 booklets.</p>
