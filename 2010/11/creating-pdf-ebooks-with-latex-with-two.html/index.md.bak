I started to look for ways to use LaTeX for doing ebooks recently. My plan is to
write an ebook on productivity and time management, with no deadline. I strive
to make it the book I'd love to read when I started reading about time
managementâ€¦ And this means I'll need quite a time.


I wanted to use LaTeX because it is the typesetting system I use for
mathematical typing, I know it well and it works wonders. The default document
classes range from book to article to report, but they weren't completely well
suited for an ebook at first look.


To solve this problem, I realised that the powerful memoir class covers a lot of
ground. Memoir lets you tweak a lot of options, and gives nicely looking books,
and with some tweaking, PDF ebooks. To test the settings, I have compiled a few
posts from this blog just as a test in a pdf ebook with 2 pages per sheet, cover
pages and such and the result looks pretty good. If you think someone may be
interested in a _Best of mostlymaths.net_, I may consider finishing it and
posting it here.

  

When the time to test the [How to do A6 booklets in 7 easy steps (with
LaTeX)](http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/11/creating-a6-booklets-in-7-easy-steps.html)
came, I went for typesetting some good books with the memoir class, and decided
to pick up the Project Gutenberg plain text files for _The Art of War_ and _How
to Live on 24 Hours a Day_.

*   **The Art of War**: [ebook formatted](AOW.pdf), [tex source](taow.tex) and
    [A6 booklet format](AOW-8x1.pdf)
*   **How to Live on 24 Hours a Day**: [ebook formatted](24Hours.pdf), [tex
    source](24hours.tex) and [A6 booklet format](24Hours-8x1.pdf)

The settings I used for memoir can be found [here](Wrapper.tex) and you can read
