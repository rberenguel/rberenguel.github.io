But it has also been a week with ideas and things and such. You know, two weeks ago I was in Dresden for a conference. Lots of parallel sessions, and quite a few time to think. This post is mostly a digest from my <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/05/life-bookmarking.html">life bookmarks</a> for these two weeks.</p>

<p>Several complex dynamic ideas: Unrelated to my thesis, but I&rsquo;ve been thinking about them these days. I even rewrote a program to test an idea, and did some calculations yesterday. Looks like it will work out, and I will be able to finish some things.</p>

<p>Heard a few interesting plenary talks: Cloaking, invisibility and inverse problems by Gunther Uhlman, who talked about theoretical solutions for creating invisible objects, as well as some real life applications like a cloaking system against tsunamis (by making an island invisible to water waves). Recovery of Data Matrices from Incomplete and Corrupted Entries by Emmanuel Candes was really interesting. He talks about a method (and related theorems) for recovering a full matrix from a very small sample of it (one of his examples was a 30000x30000 low rank matrix, where he only sampled 0.4% of its entries, and recovered the full matrix with a very low error. Really interesting! You can read the preprint in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1476">ArXiV</a>.</p>

<p>Heard also a few interesting short talks: partial differential equations related talks, mostly, also one about neuron networks. Had an idea about the wake-sleep cycle problem as a synchronization problem.</p>

<p>Ate interesting things: I didn&rsquo;t remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle">sp√§tzle</a> were that good. Should cook some day. Also tasted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho_bo">Pho bo</a> soup in a Vietnamese place, and it is really a wonderful soup.</p>

<hr />

<p>After coming back, I have also done a few things, but not so much related to my thesis</p>

<p>Installed Debian on the Ben NanoNote: Now I use emacs and org mode to keep my life bookmarking. In the nanonote you need emacs23-nox, emacs22-nox complains about little memory, don&rsquo;t really know why (it only uses 7mb, there are still a lot left!). Also, if you happen to find a bus error while reading the aptitude package list (which will appear as Bus errorackage list 0% in your console), first try to delete /var/cache/apt/*.bin (or /var/apt/cache/*.bin) and apt-get update. If it does not work&hellip; I advise you to reinstall your debian system. I was not able to solve it, and ditched Lenny for Sid, then it worked well. But if you Ctrl-C while apt-getting something, you&rsquo;ll find the bus error again, which can be solved by removing all these bin files.</p>

<p>Ordered, got and tried a pair of Fivefinger KSO&rsquo;s: These are a barefoot-like running shoes. You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JIMMNO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002JIMMNO">buy your pair from Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002JIMMNO" alt="" /> (affiliate link). They are really good, running never felt like this before.</p>

<p>Had some origami ideas: It was really long since I created something. Have a few ideas, or at least, a few things worth sharing.</p>

<p>Decided to finish unfinished things: I have one lemma left since my DEA (advanced courses) days. I need to finish its proof. I am also considering having another look at my previous thesis topic. I don&rsquo;t feel like keeping things undone is good for my mental health.</p>

<p>Discovered an interesting site: <a href="https://www.createspace.com/">CreateSpace.com</a> for self-publishing and selling in Amazon.</p>

<p>Baked an interesting dish: Very close to <a href="http://www.google.es/search?q=aeblekage">Aeblekage</a>, a Danish recipe I like a lot. Ate it today for breakfast.</p>

<hr />

<p>I don&rsquo;t know when I will be able to post this coming week&hellip; I used to write my posts in advance (usually one Friday and two Saturday), but this week I have none! But don&rsquo;t think I am not here, this is just being out of sync.</p>
