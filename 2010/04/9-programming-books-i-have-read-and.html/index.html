<p>And now, the list of the best programming books I have read so far. I&rsquo;m currently on and off with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976458705?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0976458705">Thinking Forth</a>, but it is still to early to tell if I like it. I like Forth programming (as I like Lisp, C or almost any other language&hellip;), and so far the book looks damn good. But there&rsquo;s a lot to learn from there and it will take me a while to grasp it&hellip; and consider turning this into a list of 10 books.</p>

<p>Do you have a really good programming book to suggest? Please post it in the comments, I&rsquo;ll try to have a look at it.</p>

<p>Kernighan &amp; Ritchie&rsquo;s The C Programming Language</p>

<p>This was one of the first programming books I read from cover to cover, and probably the only one I was really forced to do so. In my first year in the University, I was required to program in C, and previously I had only programmed in different flavours of Basic (Visual Basic, GW-Basic, QBasic) and Pascal (Turbo Pascal for MS-Dos and Windows). The first semester was ok, as we were taught the basics of the language, but I wanted more and started reading this book (loaned from the library). I like it a lot, learnt a lot and <strong>I still think that its clear style and simple examples make it the best language specific programming book I will ever read</strong>&hellip; If we don&rsquo;t pit it against the following. Obviously, this is a &lsquo;dry&rsquo; book: I would never recommend it to someone who was beginning to learn programming&hellip; But he should eventually read it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131101633?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131101633">Buy on Amazon link</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0131101633" alt="" /></p>

<p>Paul Graham&rsquo;s ANSI Common Lisp</p>

<p><strong>This is probably the programming book I have learnt more from.</strong> I learnt about Lisp a long, long time ago, but stalled on it until I stumbled upon Graham&rsquo;s site, and read his somewhat inspiring history behind Viaweb. Decided to give it a try, and have loved this language since then. My first buy from Amazon was this great book, and won&rsquo;t ever regret having bought it, would probably even be one of my 10 books to take to a desert island. Worth a buy, and even a second buy to give it as a present to a programmer friend.</p>

<p>Friedman &amp; Felleisen&rsquo;s The Little Lisper</p>

<p><strong>A little and short gem among programming books</strong>, teaches recursion, some programming and a little subset of the Lisp language to anybody in a short number of pages. It is worth a read, even if you have been into programming for a long time. Maybe just because it is a fun little book full of harmless jokes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0023397632?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0023397632">Buy on Amazon link</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0023397632" alt="" />Â </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> readers suggested that <em>The Little Schemer</em> is better, these days (for price, mostly). But the same review applies</p>

<p>Hunt &amp; Thomas&rsquo; The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</p>

<p>This is probably one of the most recommended books on programming, and for a clear reason: <strong>it will make your developer life easier, once you grasp everything it has to teach (although you can get a lot from day 1)</strong>. Buy it. Now. And read it as soon as you have it.</p>

<p>Adobe&rsquo;s Chapter 8 of The Postscript Programming Language Reference Manual</p>

<p>The PPLRM is a huge book, with lots and lots of information. And yet, the only part I have ever used is <em>Chapter 8: Operators</em>. Almost anything can be found in here, if you know how stack-based languages go. Concise and to the point: is just a chapter on how operators work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201379228?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0201379228">Buy on Amazon link</a> (full book, of course)</p>

<p>Watt &amp; Mangada&rsquo;s Basic para niÃ±os</p>

<p>This translates as Basic for kids, and it is a really lovely book. My first programming book, I learn a lot from it (although maybe too many goto&rsquo;s ;) It is a wonderful book for teaching programming to children between 5 and 11 years old. Do you readers know if there is something similar but up-to-date?</p>

<p>SAMS&rsquo; Teach Yourself Python in 24 hours</p>

<p>Yes, I fell for the Teach Yourself <em>X</em> in <em>N</em> hours/days, but <strong>this book is good</strong>. It feels more like an introduction to the language than one of those standard rubbish books. But after a while, you grow to hate the Mayan calendar examples the author loves, sadly.</p>

<p>Friedman &amp; Felleisen&rsquo;s A Little Java: A Few Patterns</p>

<p>I though I should give a try to another Friedman-Felleisen combination. This is not as good as _The Little LisperÂ _mentioned above, but it does not mean it&rsquo;s bad. Just not the same type of book, and also I&rsquo;m not specially fond of Java. Worth a read to get some insights about Java, but loaning from the library would be a safer bet. I would not probably buy it again.</p>

<p>Abelson &amp; Sussman&rsquo;s The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</p>

<p>A classic one&hellip; Known as <strong>The wizard book</strong>, for its cover. But I think I just read half of the book, from re-reading the Contents. Maybe I forgot everything? Focused on programming in Scheme, <strong>it teaches a lot about general computer science</strong>. Worth having, but it is quite a dense read. It is freely available.</p>
