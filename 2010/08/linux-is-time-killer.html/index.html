Probably not completely a Linux fault as an Acer one. But anyway, be warned this is a rant.</p>

<hr />

<p>Linux is a time waster. It can come in two time-wasting fashion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Good: you find a new command/application and play with it.</li>
<li>Bad: you try to configure something (or install a package from scratch).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have nothing against the good part. I even enjoy it, by learning to use <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/04/gcal-ultra-powerful-command-line-gnu.html">gcal</a>, or <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/05/command-line-postscript-swiss-knife.html">a2ps</a>. I even wrote a (guest) post on <a href="http://www.friendlyanarchist.com/luck-favours-the-procrastinator/">why I think learning these side tools can be rewarding</a>.</p>

<p>But the bad part&hellip; this always gets on my nerves. I don&rsquo;t mean that Windows is better in the bad part&hellip; but Mac OS is. Mac OS just works, but they have the best thing to be that way: all Mac computers are Apple controlled. Thus they can test everything and say &lsquo;OK&rsquo;. Every hardware part will work perfectly and smoothly with Mac OS version N.</p>

<p>Linux has to work in almost all strange configurations possible&hellip; And this means big hardware fuss. You have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmodem">winmodem</a>? You can&rsquo;t use a dial-up connection (that happened in my Pentium II days). More recently, you have an internal SD card reader? You can&rsquo;t hotplug it.</p>

<p>All started with an upgrade from Ubuntu 9.10 to 10.04. I assumed dist-upgrade was a good option, I wanted to upgrade my distribution. Then I learned, and was advised that it was a bad idea&hellip; But how could I know it beforehand? It was the first time I had to upgrade, in my office this is automatic, and previously I had so little content that overwriting with a newer version was not a problem. It looked like the best tool for the job. The ~6 hours process began, and finally, ended.</p>

<p>Without keyboard, without trackpad, without USB. I had something similar to a brick, under X11. I could boot in console mode and tinker to solve it. I googled and digged into forums, and after around 2 hours I found some maybe solutions. Tried two (both took a while of editing) and they didn&rsquo;t work at all. Gave up (I remember fighting against X11 back in my pure Debian days, and it not enjoyable) and tried to download the latest Ubuntu to install from a Flash drive. Did you know that Ubuntu no longer gives system boot images you can write in USB flash drives? It is either net-install (but how do you boot it?) or CD. It looks like a good move in these days where netbooks have no CD drive. In case you are interested, you can find a flash drive image <a href="http://linuxtracker.org/index.php?page=torrent-details&amp;id=c54b4dd3f1ab9d50a25ebdccc7157fc843292784">here</a>.</p>

<p>This process started around 11 am and ended 11 am the day after. Then add quite a few more hours for installing all programs I use, and configuring a few of them. Luckily, I use <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2009/07/acer-aspire-one-89-ubuntu-fluxbox.html">fluxbox</a> and <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2009/09/auctex-again.html">emacs</a> where configuration back-up is a dream.</p>

<p>Roughly two days for a system upgrade.</p>

<p>Then, the other day, I had some pictures I wanted to post somewhere. Don&rsquo;t remember exactly, and put my SD card in my right-hand internal reader. Nothing. D&rsquo;oh! I remembered I had to enable hotplugging when booting, by adding some lines somewhere. Googled for a while, found the solution I used back in my 9.04 days.Which needed writing in a non-existent file. Duh. Ok, look for a solution for Ubuntu 10.04. More googling. Several tries (which mean edit, reboot and try). Nothing, I only got the LH reader working. The right one, which is the easily removable, the LH is an expansion slot, isn&rsquo;t. Just from upgrading from 9.10 to 10.04.</p>

<p>And it took me one other day.</p>

<p>These are just two of my everyday examples, and I guess you could share a few of your own. More if you are a sysadmin, or do something with web servers. Share your story, it will relax you. At least, I feel a little better.</p>
