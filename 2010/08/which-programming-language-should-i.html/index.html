<p>I have a problem: I know quite a lot different programming languages (you can read my list of the <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/04/9-programming-books-i-have-read-and.html">best 9 books I have read about programming</a>), but I am proficient only in two. I&rsquo;d love to choose a few to concentrate and build my skills up, but I don&rsquo;t know which. Read on for background and possible candidates.</p>

<p>Since I discovered there were different programming languages, I&rsquo;ve liked learning different ones. It is the same with languages, I love learning new languages.</p>

<p>But I have focus problems, and after a while I just give up and forget half of what I learnt. I can write in C and Lisp without much problems, except for looking some function up in the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/">Lisp Hyperspec</a> and a recurring forgetting of how <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_do_do.htm#do">do</a> is used. But my working knowledge quickly decreases:</p>

<p>Awk: wrote several scripts to solve some problems, but could not write anything out of the cold. Useful enough for what I do in awk.</p>

<p>Bash: wrote more than a few scripts. As bash is not hat deep I guess I know enough for my uses.</p>

<p>Forth: wrote a little to see how it goes, but not enough. I like stack based languages.</p>

<p>Java: I have a little working knowledge and a small cheat-sheet I wrote and used. I had a course on databases where we had to write a mail back-end (SQL) and write accessing user code in Java. Learnt enough to do it, no more as I had no time back then.</p>

<p>JavaScript: wrote several na√Øve scripts. They work, but are pretty amateurish.</p>

<p>PostScript: wrote a few programs and a small tutorial. Used too little to work from scratch, but enough for what I actually use it.</p>

<p>Python: wrote a few small programs and read a few times a book. Didn&rsquo;t code for long enough to write programs out from scratch.</p>

<p>I want to pick one language from this list or new (or a few, no more than 3) and really get into them, up to being able to write code out of the blue. If possible, not too amateurish code. In my free coding I usually do fun things&hellip; I have <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2009/06/lisp-raytracing-again.html">half a raytracer</a> and half a SIRDS generator, both in Lisp. I also have an <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/04/approximating-images-with-randomly.html">image approximator by triangles</a>, stochastic, in C. These are slow programs, requiring quite a work of optimising. Now, I don&rsquo;t know which languages I should choose next, less in view of what I use them for. General usefulness is welcome (if I can get something out of a language I learn in my free time, the better). Here are the options I am considering, together with pro&rsquo;s and cons. If you think something is missing for your favourite language, please tell me so!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I consider being hyped as a pro feature, because it means it has a wide array of developers and documentation, not because I want to learn the top of the wave language right now.</p>

<h3 id="clojure">Clojure</h3>

<p>Pros (Clojure): It is a Lisp based language, and this means that I have a great deal already learned. It is also being hyped and talked about. I have already written some kind of hello world program in it, in my post <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/08/and-e-appears-from-nowhere.html">And &lsquo;e&rsquo; appears from nowhere</a> I approximated e using Clojure. Google Trends indicate the language is currently in a local decline from an increasing trend.</p>

<p>Cons (Clojure): But I know very little Java, thus I could not get the full power of the language straight out. Also, I don&rsquo;t know what I would use it for. How fast is Clojure? How does its memory management work?</p>

<h3 id="factor">Factor</h3>

<p>Pros (Factor): Factor is a Forth like language with a deep set of libraries. It is currently being actively developed.<br />
Cons (Factor): I feel like I don&rsquo;t know enough of he &lsquo;mother&rsquo; language, Forth, to switch to a derivative. Not enough volume to show in Google Trends.</p>

<h3 id="go">Go</h3>

<p>Pros (Go): Written by Google and actively developed. Much hyped. It is very much C-like.<br />
Cons (Go): Google Wave was killed, it could also happen to Go. Also, I guess pure C would be faster for a C-like compiled language, thus I could use C instead. Google Trends doesn&rsquo;t seem to indicate it is very interesting. A big spike on anouncement and a bumpy constant curve afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3>

<p>Pros (Ruby): Hyped a lot. Looks like everyone around is using it for something. Steady constant curve in Google Trends.</p>

<p>Cons (Ruby): As of now, I don&rsquo;t even know if it is compiled or interpreted, or what it is good for.</p>

<h3 id="javascript-in-depth-with-jquery-and-node-js">JavaScript (in depth with jQuery and node.js)</h3>

<p>Pros (JavaScript): I could write a few iPhone apps I have in mind in JS. I know a little JS already, and it is pretty much an interesting language.<br />
Cons (JavaScript): Too much work for too little output, maybe. I don&rsquo;t even know if there are good references for in-depth Javascript, or for jQuery/node.js. Declining (heavily) in Google Trends, but jQuery and node.js are rising strongly.</p>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<p>Pros (Python): From what I already read and programmed, it feels like a wonderful language, very thought out. His creator even has a beard!<br />
Cons (Python): I don&rsquo;t know what uses I could put it for. Speed would be an issue for a lot of programs I may write, but not for all of them, of course. Slight decline in Google Trends.</p>

<p>Thus, what do you suggest? If I was to choose right now, I would probably pick Python, Forth and Clojure (although I&rsquo;m afraid of how much Java I need for it). Which one would you pick? Or which 2-3 languages do you suggest for me? Do you think 3 languages at the same (probably not same as in the same day or week) time are too many?</p>
