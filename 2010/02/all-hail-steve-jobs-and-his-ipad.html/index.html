<p>All hail <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_Futurama#Hypnotoad">hypnotoad</a>&hellip; in real life</p>

<p>I want to start by saying that I might buy an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad">iPad</a>, and definitely like it, in an abstract setting. But I think that Steve Jobs is kind of blind through his own charisma. He likes the iPad&hellip; then it should be liked (and bought) by everyone.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the iPad is gona be a hit. It would, if it was priced 200$ below its said price (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad#Pricing">$499</a>--&gt;$299). At that price, it would surely break the market. I would definitely buy one. But at the current price, it is exactly what almost every Apple geek was hoping it was not: an oversized iPod Touch.</p>

<p>I love my iPod Touch&hellip; and of course, a bigger one would surely make my day. Not at that price, though. It is not really good as a book reader (LCD vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Ink">eInk</a> was a battle lost a few years ago), nor as a video player (why should you be at the sofa, at home watching it in front of your real TV?). You can&rsquo;t exactly work on it on whatever you want: it runs iPhone OS, not Mac OS.</p>

<p>What everyone was hoping on the iTablet, iBook, or as it turned out, iPad was a tablet powered by Mac OS, or some new cool operating system that would do the job. A gadget that could replace your laptop on short trips, where you could keep on working on whatever you were working in your office/home. But they give us an iPod Touch x 4&hellip; You can just work on writing emails, and I think in Pages. Oh, or Notes.</p>

<p>My iPod is jailbroken&hellip; so I can do a lot more things on it&hellip; But why should I be forced to do this on a $500 gadget? It should work *better*, right out of the box. And it can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>But, on the other side, as a $300 gadget&hellip; it works pretty decently as a book reader (I read on my iTouch regularly), it can play music, draw and watch HD videos. For the price difference, you expect &ldquo;something more&rdquo;, if you don&rsquo;t have it you can get over it&hellip; or don&rsquo;t.</p>
