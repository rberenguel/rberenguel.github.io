I like napping in the sofa
We adopted him last Saturday, and he is 2 months old. He is named after French mathematician Pierre Fatou&hellip; Mostly because Laia didn&rsquo;t want him to be named Kolmogorov, and Fatou was the first mathematician name she liked.
He is very cute (as you can see), and well-mannered. Last Monday he had to go to the veterinary clinic for a revision, and the vet told us it is amazing how good he is: he even wears his collar!" />

<p>I like napping in the sofa</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>At the moment he has a cold, and sneezes quite often. He also loves wool strings and playing with balls, which he moves around with his front paws somewhat like a hockey player.</p>

<p>He has a little injure in his back leg which makes he misstep a little when he is running at top speed. The vet told us he is too young to really do something about it except keeping him from playing too much.</p>

<p>To avoid filling <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/">mostlymaths.net</a> with posts with pictures from him, he decided on his own to open a (photo)blog at tumblr, which you can reach at <a href="http://fatou-the-cat.tumblr.com/">Fatou The Cat</a>. You can subscribe to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/tumblr/ffpM">his RSS here</a>. He will probably post a picture with a small caption (or a video with a small caption) daily, if he is not napping, of course!</p>

<p>Come <a href="http://fatou-the-cat.tumblr.com/">in</a> and say hello to Fatou!</p>
