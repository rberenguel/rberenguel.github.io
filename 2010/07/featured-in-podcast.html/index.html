<p>The interview where my blog was mentioned was <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=239">Hanselminutiae Eight: Interview with Dan Fernandez</a>, and the post they talked about was <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/03/8-reasons-for-re-inventing-wheel-as.html">8 reasons for reinventing the wheel as a programmer</a>, after it appeared in HackerNews for a second time. I thought you could not re-post things to HackerNews, but it looks like I was wrong!</p>
