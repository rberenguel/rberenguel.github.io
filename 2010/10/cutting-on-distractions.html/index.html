<p>Hey! Look! A squirrel!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gillesgonthier/1440402544/">GillesGonthier@Flickr</a></p>

<p>A few weeks ago <strong>I realised I was procrastinating too much</strong>. I tend to work in cycles, and it looked like my productive cycle was over and my procrastinator half had just kicked in the worse possible moment: <em>lectures had just begun</em>.</p>

<p>It looked like there was no solution. My <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/06/timeboxing-you-will-work-like-never.html">timeboxing</a> strategies went nowhere, <a href="http://litemind.com/will-do-lists/">will-do lists</a> (<em>litemind.com</em>) had no real meaning, carrot-and-stick solutions didn&rsquo;t work. Nothing seemed to work at all.</p>

<p>But I knew what it really was. As Steven Pressfield explains in <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/09/book-review-war-of-art-by-steven.html">The War of Art</a>, this was <em>resistance</em>. My inner demon fighting against me. I needed to strike back, and strike hard. Living my life was on the line.</p>

<p>The first step is the subject of this post, <em><strong>cutting on distractions</strong></em>, in particular <strong>web distractions</strong>. Previously I had been using <a href="http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock.html">Leechblock</a> (a Firefox addon, see my <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/04/stop-it-no-more-idle-browser-while.html">review of Leechblock</a>) to keep me from browsing for longer than a set time. It worked, but wasn&rsquo;t perfect. Moreover I am using (and loving) Chrome now. This time I decided to act different.</p>

<p>The problem was that my web browser was always open, and it usually had a Gmail tab, a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#%21/pages/mostlymathsnet/105711446118221">Facebook</a> tab and a <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/04/stop-it-no-more-idle-browser-while.html">twitter</a> tab. Too easy to procrastinate on these. I just don&rsquo;t do this anymore. And this is the key. <strong>Sounds easy? <em>It is not.</em></strong></p>

<p>I am addicted to checking my email and twitter constantly, checking my AdSense account and blog analytics repeatedly during the day. I can easily get a moment off, move from twitter to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and then my morning is gone. Wasting my time.</p>

<p><strong>I just gave it up.</strong> I force myself to check email or blog statistics only in idle time (compiling, printing, these odd minutes just before going to lunch), and <strong>no more</strong>.</p>

<p>To <strong>keep track of my twitter stream</strong>, I use <a href="http://paper.li/berenguel">paper.li</a>, a wonderful free web app that turns your timeline into a kind of newspaper, with all links collected for your enjoyment. If I find an interesting but longish post, I add it to <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/">Read It Later</a> to read while commuting in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1O18?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001FA1O18">iPod Touch</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001FA1O18" alt="" />. And at night I check my timeline for written tweets. I also use <a href="http://notifo.com/">notifo</a> in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1O18?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001FA1O18">iPod Touch</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001FA1O18" alt="" /> to get a sound alert whenever someone sends me an <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/berenguel">@berenguel</a> tweet, thus I can answer promptly.</p>

<p><strong>These may sound like trivial solutions, but they are working wonders so far</strong>. I am only opening <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#%21/pages/mostlymathsnet/105711446118221">Facebook</a> in the morning and night for just a few minutes, my twitter stream is almost rotting during the day (although I do tweet) and I am being more productive than the previous 2 months.</p>

<p>Of course this works because it has a <strong>cumulative effect</strong>. First I drew from my willpower to start, then the ball started rolling on its own, and now I just don&rsquo;t feel the urge to have Gmail always on, or check my blog analytics. They are good as they are, and will wait. It is amazing how just a day of giving up on these felt, and since then the feeling is only getting stronger.</p>

<p>Do you have the willpower to start it? The endurance to keep on it? The pay-out is staggering: <strong><em>you will win back your life</em></strong>.</p>
