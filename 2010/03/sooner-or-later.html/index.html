<p>And the day had to come. To celebrate this approximate anniversary, I&rsquo;m moving to my own domain and preparing a new look that will appear in about two weeks. Start pointing your links at <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net">www.mostlymaths.net</a> which currently acts as a mirror of my usual URL. The old link will turn into a redirect to <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net">www.mostlymaths.net</a> in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>You may wonder where the name of the domain comes from. I see it as an embodiment of my workday. On a typical day I do, mostly maths. But the rest of the time I do a bunch of other things, which are precisely the ones I usually blog about.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the new design, and spread the word of the domain name change!</p>
