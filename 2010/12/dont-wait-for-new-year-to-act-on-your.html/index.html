    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l justify "><p>During this week you will hear and read a lot about New Year&rsquo;s resolutions. Questions like what do you want to change in your life for the next year and what good habits do you want to build next year are assumed to be always in your mind now. And they should, but not <em>just</em> now.</p>

<p>New Year is only a psychological landmark, and a very bad one. Something like 70% of those good intentions you had while the previous year was ending fade into oblivion before February 1st. <strong>Forget about <em>New Year Resolutions</em></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to do something, do it now</strong>. You will be the same person 31st December 23:59 and 1st January 0:00. <a href="http://ryanwaggoner.com/2010/12/you-will-not-be-a-different-person-tomorrow/" target="_blank">Ryan Waggoner</a> also made this point very recently, in a post about delaying things for tomorrow and then not doing them. I don&rsquo;t completely agree with him, as I&rsquo;m a fan of the <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/12/book-review-do-it-tomorrow.html" target="_blank">Do It Tomorrow time management system</a>, but his point should be used for tasks that are just put off until tomorrow, not scheduled for tomorrow.</p>

<p>If you want to start writing your book, the best moment is now. Pick a pen and paper and draft. If you want to quit smoking, throw all your cigarettes. If you want to do more exercise, put your running shoes and start strolling around your neighborhood. If you want to start your own business, decide on what, research the competence. If you want to learn a new language, go buy a teach yourself book for that language. <strong>If you really want, do it NOW</strong>.</p>

<p>There is no point in delaying things that you want to do until New Year. <strong>Start now, and you will begin the year with a real difference in your life, ready to last until 31st December of he coming year</strong>.</p>
