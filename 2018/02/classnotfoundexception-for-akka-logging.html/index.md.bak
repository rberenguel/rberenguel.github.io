A few months ago I stumbled into the problem of Akka logging, specifically
ClassNotFoundException when using `akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLoggingFilter`, just by
following the details of the [Logging - SL4J section of Akka
documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/logging.html).

Of course, the
error source is obvious in hindsight, but in the moment the fact that this was a
multiproject build with several dependency paths made me miss a crucial reason
for longer than I want to admit:

**YOU NEED TO ADD THE SL4J IMPORT IF YOU WANT TO USE SL4J FOR LOGGING!**


Add this to your dependencies (I'm assuming you have a val for akkaVersion to DRY):  

```sbt
"com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-slf4j" Â % akkaVersion
```
