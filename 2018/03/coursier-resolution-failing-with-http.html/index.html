</code></pre>

<p>I ran into this problem with <code>sbt</code> dependency resolution around 7 weeks ago. I was in a hurry, so I commented out the offending import (since it was not in the subproject I was working on, so was not needed for the run I was in) sent my commit to the heavens and <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> was happy.</p>

<p>I was not happy though. For the next weeks (sounds like a lot, but it was more like 2 commits), every time I had to work on this project I was commenting the import to get it to compile/run/test. Until I was fed up enough to check what the problem was.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-response-code-416">What is response code 416</h2>

<p>This is <em>Range Not Satisfiable</em>. This means that either the file we are requesting does not have this range available: it is shorter, or the range is malformed, or who knows. The expectation should be that under a 416 error, a full request is issued, but this was not the case with Coursier (I created the <a href="https://github.com/coursier/coursier/issues/794">issue</a> and <a href="https://github.com/coursier/coursier/pull/795">submitted a PR</a> to fix it, should be fixed in the next release).</p>

<p>So&hellip; Maven Central is not able to answer range queries? Some edge case is being hit? And, what are range queries used for? This one is easy, for resuming partial downloads.</p>

<p>The likely culprit was me (or my network) stopping <code>sbt</code> while it was fetching the libraries, at some point in the past… maybe. There is a partial download <em>somewhere</em>. Easy fix: clean up the partial download that is lying there, then <code>update</code>. Problem is, <em>somewhere</em> can be more than one place with <code>coursier</code>. Also, I wasn’t sure where the problem was coming from.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-remove">What to remove</h2>

<p>In my case, I had to remove the <code>coursier</code> local cache at <code>\~/.coursier/cache</code> because this is where the partial download for <code>gelfj</code> was. But it might have been any of <code>.ivy2/cache</code> or <code>.m2/cache</code>. Maybe, even, <code>sbt</code> cache at <code>.sbt/</code> . Or the <code>ensime</code> cache.</p>

<h2 id="reproducing-fixing">Reproducing, fixing</h2>

<p>I managed to reproduce it relatively easily. Open any location in your <code>.coursier/cache/v1</code> folder containing a JAR file. Move said jar to <code>blah.jar.part</code>. This way, it has full size as a partial download, and the requested range in a partial download request will be invalid (actually this was what was happening in my case: Coursier died just before moving <code>.part</code> to <code>.jar</code>). If you run <code>sbt update</code> under <code>coursier</code> on any project using this JAR, resolution will fail with a 416.</p>

<p>Fixing it was straightforward (the code base for <code>coursier</code> seems easy to search) by adding a check for this return code in the area that resets the connection if the returned headers are not valid.</p>

<p>To test the functionality I used <code>sbt-plugins/publish-local</code> to create a SNAPSHOT build I could set in my <code>.sbt</code>. Once I got the bug manually tested I ran the tests suites. I wanted to add a test, but this seemed untestable under the current suites, so I pushed and waited. The <a href="https://github.com/alexarchambault">lead maintainer</a> gave me some pointers on how to create a test using the current systems (I got very close but didn’t work in the end), and then, a PR by <a href="https://github.com/wisechengyi">wisechengyi</a> added several helpers for testing a PR he created in a similar situation, so I could add a test to mine. And done!</p>
