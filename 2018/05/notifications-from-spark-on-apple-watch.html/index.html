    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l justify "><p>This week I have been working a lot with a relatively large dataset on a Spark shell. It was a graph with 1 billion nodes and 2 billion edges that I wanted to analyse with <a href="https://github.com/graphframes/graphframes">GraphFrames</a> (the successor of <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.1/graphx-programming-guide.html">GraphX</a> on Spark). This is quite large: before running the graph algorithms I did some exploratory analysis, and each step took at least 10 minutes. Checking stage/task progress bars or generated analysis plans is only interesting for the first fee&hellip; I wanted a way to get a subtle notification when the process finished. This way I could work on something else while the process is doing its thing, and I could come back for the next step as soon as the data is ready.</p>

<p>I have most of my notifications deactivated, though. No emails, Twitter, WhatsApp. Nothing shows on my Mac screen, very few show on my <a href="https://amzn.to/2reDmZl">phone</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kq0Lid">watch</a>, and only a handful are allowed to vibrate (none to make a sound). What could I do to get a notification? Even if I overrode some of my settings, I needed something that either could work cross-device or could make my watch vibrate, since it’s the only device I have always with me.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="https://ifttt.com/discover">IFTTT</a> can actually do that. IFTTT is a service to plumb external services with iOS/Android devices, to build workflows. It also has a <a href="https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks">very handy webhook you can use as a trigger for workflows</a>. And the IFTTT app can send notifications, to the phone or watch. Ticks all the boxes.</p>

<p>To use the webhook (a POST endpoint) from Scala I used a library I had never used before: <a href="https://ifttt.com/discover">scalaj-http</a> It seems very convenient for these quick-and-dirty “make a request” in a program that includes no other http library.</p>

<p>When I have some action I expect to run for a while, I’ll finish the command with <code>; notif(“Process X finished”)</code> This way, when the command finishes my wrist will gently buzz and I’ll know I can go back to work more on it.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this would also work for a long running bash or sbt command (I’m looking at you, Spark test suite), or compiling <code>boost</code> or anything else that can, basically, run <code>curl</code> against an endpoint at the end of the process.</p>

<p>By the way, to run a spark shell with this library, use</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>spark-shell --packages org.scalaj:scalaj-http_2.11:2.3.0</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that multiple packages are separated by commas in case you also happen to, you know, use GraphFrames.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you happen to want notifications after an sbt task, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/rberenguel/sbt-ifttt">sbt-ifttt plugin</a>.</p>
