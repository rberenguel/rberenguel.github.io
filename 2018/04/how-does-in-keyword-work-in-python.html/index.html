    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-75-l justify dropcap"><p>A few days go I played a bit with a naive implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom
filters</a> in Python. I wanted to time
them against just checking whether a field is in a set/collection. I found
something slightly puzzling: it looked like the <code>in</code> worked <em>too fast</em> for
smaller lists. And I wondered: maybe small lists are special internally, and
allow for really fast lookups? Maybe they have some internal index? This raised
the question: how does <code>in</code> find stuff <em>in</em> sequences?</p>
<p>Instead of reading the documentation I delved into the
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">cpython</a> source. Skipping the documentation
was a bad idea, since it is not only pretty comprehensive but explains
everything… if you know what you are looking for. But a dive into this big
pile of C was more fun. I was also stupid enough to not Google the answer until
I was editing this post… When writing this, I found out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12244378">this excellent Stack Overflow
answer</a> covers more or less what I explain
here.</p>
<p>The <code>in</code> keyword (defined
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/graminit.c#L2195">here</a>)
is actually a shorthand for running <code>__contains__</code> from the target object, you
probably know this already. Your class will be able to provide <code>in</code> if you add
this magic method, you can read about this in the first chapter of <a href="https://amzn.to/2GEEZct">Fluent
Python</a>. But tracing this inside <code>cpython</code> is a bit
cumbersome and got me diving into interesting pieces of the code. By the way,
how the Python compiler works is documented
<a href="https://devguide.python.org/compiler/">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, after we have parsed the code and generated a parse tree from our text,
we go to the abstract syntax tree. Converting the string <code>in</code> as part of some
node of Python source in this tree into <em>an</em> <code>In</code>
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast.c#L1163">here</a>:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/2fa518c6150c951228cdbb13f94fb3fe.js"></script>

<p>And now, what does actually <code>in</code> do? Well, we need to move forward in the
compilation chain, and check
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/a95d98607efe0c43475b354543e49bf8e240bc6f/Python/compile.c#L2185">compile.c</a>:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/2b1b844d8a2432771bde136f3857f67d.js"></script>

<p>This is inside a function called <code>cmpop</code>, which is called when we find the
<code>COMPARE_OP</code> opcode. This is the opcode we’d see by disassembling anything
running <code>in</code> or <code>==</code> or any other comparison operator (all comparison operators
are in the same basket, see
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/702f8f3611bc49b73772cce2b9b041bd11ff9b35/Include/opcode.h#L139">here</a>).
We can follow the route through
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d8b291a74284307610946f1b5801aa95d7f1e052/Python/ceval.c#L4685">ceval.c</a>
now:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/c0ad8b35a80f57ee0d38b5858e5c5ea6.js"></script>

<p>So, we are calling this <code>PySequence_Contains</code> thingy. A bit more grep and we can
find it defined in
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/f320be77ffb73e3b9e7fc98c37b8df3975d84b40/Objects/abstract.c#L2037">abstract.c</a>:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/dc95cf3a932dcf978d057bde2a831c9d.js"></script>

<p>And now we can see what it does:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a pointer to the sequence’s base sequence methods in the C struct slot <code>tp_as_sequence</code></li>
<li>If there is a <code>sq_contains</code> method pointer there, invoke it and return</li>
<li>Otherwise, use iterative search</li>
</ol>
<p>Hey, where is my <code>__contains__</code>? The magic happens on new object/class/type
definition:
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c3d9508ff22ece9a96892b628dd5813e2fb0cd80/Objects/typeobject.c#L4711">typeobject.c</a>
The base object all classes extend from looks like the following struct (from
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/a5552f023e1d8cbafee1e51d316cc581deb2295f/Include/object.h#L346">object.h</a>):</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/e80a7d4ff1c8260029942346865870c0.js"></script>

<p>This means that, technically, all objects have a field in their defining struct
for sequences: <code>tp_as_sequence</code>. This is populated when we define a new class
(which internally is known as <em>type</em>) in
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c3d9508ff22ece9a96892b628dd5813e2fb0cd80/Objects/typeobject.c#L2602">typeobject.c</a>.
Slots <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c3d9508ff22ece9a96892b628dd5813e2fb0cd80/Objects/typeobject.c#L2515">are populated from what is essentially a dictionary of
methods</a>
by invoking
<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=13497321">fixup_slot_dispatchers</a>.
This maps the python name <code>__contains__</code> to the corresponding slot in the
struct, <code>sq_contains</code> and defines which function sets it up,
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c3d9508ff22ece9a96892b628dd5813e2fb0cd80/Objects/typeobject.c#L6098">slot_sq_contains</a>:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/acef7aec405d402b99266635a293c8b1.js"></script>

<p>Built-in objects (and likely libraries with C extensions) implement these directly in C, and point its slot to the C method:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/b5299798f3222c9be0951b769fc61c41.js"></script>

<p>Finally, this method looks for a method defined in the class and called <code>__contains__</code>. If it is <code>None</code> (that is, it is defined and is <code>None</code>), object is not a container, that’s it. If it is <em>not defined</em> (hence the null, and this one is actually puzzling&hellip; reduces to it not being provided when defining the class&hellip; I think), Python falls back to iterating for search using <code>__iter__</code> (which is what eventually gets called under <code>PySequence_IterSearch</code>). If this is also not valid or available, an error returns, following a chain of -1 in the method lookups.</p>
<p>If you have been paying attention you’ll see that we are actually deferring to iterative search in two places: when defining the slot in <code>sq_contains</code> but also when invoking <code>PySequence_Contains</code>. I’m not 100% sure about why this is the case, and experimenting with the REPL does not get you very far, since you can never be sure if you are hitting <code>PySequence_Contains -&gt; PY_ITERSEARCH_CONTAINS</code> or <code>PySequence_Contains -&gt; sq_contains -&gt; PY_ITERSEARCH_CONTAINS</code> without changing the messages (and I don’t feel like recompiling <code>Cpython</code>). Weirdly, the second case should be faster since it is going straight for the method via the slot without needing an extra method lookup.</p>
<p>As expected, dictionary lookup is fancier. It is a common and known performance improvement in Python to change lists or other sequence-like datatypes for dictionaries, since they show the best performance for most operations. Since internally in Python everything from methods/functions to classes is implemented in one way or another as dictionaries (or reusing the machinery that is built for dictionaries), anything that speeds dictionaries up, speeds the whole of Python code. Of <em>course</em>, dictionary lookup is <em>usually</em> fast no matter the language: hash table lookup in general (leaving aside how collision resolution might be implemented in lookup) is O(1) fast. Note that below we have the macro: <code>#define PyUnicode_CheckExact(op) (Py_TYPE(op) == &amp;PyUnicode_Type)</code></p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/c35eec71f0dc25134d571c2be8ecb44a.js"></script>

<p>There even is a specialised method for cases when the hash key is known (not sure of the use case, since magic methods are hardcoded in the object structs, maybe it’s used to optimise tighter loops?).</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/0c419252c5e707384656a3a35e6af84d.js"></script>

<p>And if you wonder how <code>key in dict</code> works, it is of course by introducing the method in the struct for sequences. The snippet below is from <code>dictobject.c</code>, as the methods above.</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/13d47f995b443511abb2abd4b454b2e7.js"></script>

<p>And here finishes my exploration of <code>cpython</code> to figure out how <code>in</code> contains. Not sure about you, but I had a lot of fun.</p><hr/>
