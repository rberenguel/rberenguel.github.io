<p>Back when I started writing HTML for myself, one of the best reading experiences I saw was <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham&rsquo;s one-column text</a>. Also, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/gfaq.html">the reasoning</a> makes sense. When I needed to redesign <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/">mostlymaths</a> I tried to go one-column, but I fell for the sidebar trap. Added a section with most-viewed posts, an Amazon widget, a post archive&hellip; Lots. Of. Crap.</p>

<p>I had been thinking about cleaning up everything for quite a few months and then <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgemmell">Matt Gemmell</a> posted a very interesting post: <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/05/22/designing-blogs-for-readers/">Designing Blogs for Readers</a>. I have been following his twitter account and posting for a while, and many ideas in this post rang a bell.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks I have been putting off several writing ideas saying to myself: I&rsquo;ll write it when I do the new design. So screw it, the other day I devoted like 45 minutes to clean up everything. I borrowed a pair of numbers from Matt&rsquo;s CSS (font-size and font-height, mine are slightly larger but are close to his) and basically deleted every design thing that wasn&rsquo;t useful.</p>

<p>I have killed comments. This was hard, because I love interacting with readers, and quite a few of my best tweeps have started with me commenting on their blogs or them commenting in mine. But as of late, I have been neglecting answering and moderating, and the best solution was to remove them. If you want to comment, feel free to click on contact on top. I&rsquo;m not very fast answering my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; email either, but eventually I do. You can also reach me over <a href="https://twitter.com/berenguel">twitter</a> or the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mostlymaths">Facebook page for mostlymaths</a> without many problems.</p>

<p>I left a lone ad on the side (I may turn it into 300x250, but for now I like how small it looks) and I will probably add social sharing at the bottom and find a good way to inline code (no, I don&rsquo;t like github styled widgets). Currently you can&rsquo;t even share what you read here. This is not exactly done on purpose, but after all, if you want to share something you can do it without needing a button. I know I do.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you are subscribed by email you may have received a stupid-looking email with many images. Sorry! Messed up with a draft post where I store images I have used.</p>
