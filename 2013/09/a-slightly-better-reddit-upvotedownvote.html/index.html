I wanted a reddit button in one of our websites, and our technical guy wanted it to be asynchronous. After a little poking around and deciding that reddit doesn&rsquo;t offer asynchronous buttons, I rolled my poor man&rsquo;s version: wrap it in a $(document).ready() It&rsquo;s not asynchronous, but at least it won&rsquo;t block page loading.</p>

<p>Both happy, we deployed and I tested. Worked well, no problem. Well, actually, yes. A problem shared by all reddit buttons, one that was very troublesome here in <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/" target="_blank">mostlymaths</a> (back when I had a share on reddit button just beside the post title.)</p>

<p>When setting up the button you select the target reddit you&rsquo;d rather have your users send your content. In a page about Apple stuff, it would be r/apple. The problem is though that your users are free and can do whatever they want. So they go and submit to r/technology. Fine, r/technology is cool enough, lots of readers. Trouble is, when a user arrives from r/technology to your blog, after clicking on the link&hellip; He will see your widget with an ugly <em>submit</em> text, and no upvotes or downvotes:</p>

<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IoEOQ_CqzqY/UjsE3OopywI/AAAAAAAADnY/vbK9mw-cf_g/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-09-19+at+4.03.58+PM.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IoEOQ_CqzqY/UjsE3OopywI/AAAAAAAADnY/vbK9mw-cf_g/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-09-19+at+4.03.58+PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>even though your post has quite a few votes already in r/technology. The trouble comes from setting the target subreddit beforehand: if the url is not in this subreddit, reddit looks nowhere else. Of course, you&rsquo;d rather have:</p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LkdIbtSWVy8/UjsFpSFlNdI/AAAAAAAADnk/8eP9n8h4uhI/s1600/25points.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LkdIbtSWVy8/UjsFpSFlNdI/AAAAAAAADnk/8eP9n8h4uhI/s1600/25points.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>with the real counter. After all, this means making the experience completely seamless:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reddit user sees a cool link to your content in r/whatever. Clicks</li>
<li>Lands on your page</li>
<li>Upvotes (or downvotes)</li>
</ol>

<p>instead of</p>

<ol>
<li>Reddit user sees a cool link to your content in r/whatever. Clicks</li>
<li>Lands on the page</li>
<li>Tries to upvote, needs to submit instead</li>
<li>Is forced to submit to r/whatever, gives up (or not)</li>
</ol>

<p>An easy way to solve this problem is to check the referring URL. If it matches a subreddit, we can set the target of our widget to <em>that</em> subreddit instead of the default one. <strong>All reddit readers happy!</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another issue, though: users not arriving from reddit.</p>

<p>A random user landing in your awesome post, which has a bazillion points in r/whatever likes your content, and wants to upvote it. But, alas! He sees the dreaded submit button, because our default is r/apple. Or worse, sees 0 (or even a negative number!) because it has been downvoted in our target subreddit.</p>

<p>This can also be solved. Reddit offers a clear-cut json API, allowing jsonp callbacks. This means that we can write a small piece of javascript that will check whether our post has been submitted to another reddit AND change the target to <em>that</em> one! <strong>All reddit users happy!</strong></p>

<p>Below you can find the code. Fork it, use it, whatever. Be happy. If something breaks or doesn&rsquo;t work as expected it&rsquo;s not my fault: use cases may vary.</p>
