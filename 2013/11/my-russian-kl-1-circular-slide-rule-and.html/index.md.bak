A few months ago (woah, so long already) I had an impulse buy: I purchased a
circular slide rule from Etsy. It was cheap, and I had always wanted one, soâ€¦
I just bought it (a neat addition to my
[Addiator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiator).)

I guess if you are geeky enough to read `mostlymaths.net`, you know how a slide
rule works. Although I knew how to use it, getting to grips with it took a
little while. Just to make sure you follow along here's a brief explanation.

In a normal rule (as pictured below) you can measure a distance, add the
distance to another one and get a new distance. 4 and 4 are 8, see?

A slide rule works exactly the same, but the scale on the rule is logarithmic.
This means that if you measure the distance between 1 and 3, and add it to the
point 3, you get 9 (which is 3 times 3.) This is because in a linear scale
distance measures the difference ($b-a$) and in a logarithmic scale it measure
ratios ($b/a$)

{{< figure src="ExampleSlideRule.png" class="fig-wide">}}

 
Usually you will do this using a piece labeled the same as the slide rule: 

{{< figure src="ExampleSlideRule2.png" class="fig-wide">}}

In a normal slide rule (the long wooden or aluminium thing) you have several
scales, all placed together with an indicator to know where to measure. In the
simplest setting a slide rule is basically what is shown above: a way to fix a
distance and displace it along. You could do it with your fingers, even.

In a basic model of circular slide rule (like the KL-1) you have something that
works much like this. See the picture below: 

{{< figure src="CloseUpLog.jpg" class="fig-wide">}} 

If you look carefully you'll see a marker (which is place just below a knob, and
fixed in the glass cover) and a red marking needle (it's hard to see, but it's
red.) In this picture you'll also see the logarithmic scale (below, from 1 to 9)
and a square scale just on top (from 1 to 90.)

 

The black knob (on top of the fixed marker) displaces the scale, leaving the red
marking needle wherever it is (it moves the paper where the scale is written)
and the red knob (the other one) moves just the needle, hovering above the
paper.

If you set the black marker on 1 by moving the black knob and then the red
marker on (for example) $\sqrt{2}$ (which is the number just below 2 in the
square scale) you are fixing the ratio $1-\sqrt{2}$ (roughly $1-1.4$)

{{< figure src="Sqrt2.jpg" class="fig-wide">}} 


If you now twist the black knob, you are moving the scale while the distance
black-red remains perfectly fixed. So if you place the black marker above 2, you
are "adding" the ratio of $\sqrt{2}$ and 2, which means $2 \cdot \sqrt{2}$ (roughly
2.8):

So, no mysteries in how this works! In the back there are a few trigonometric
scales (known in the slide rule lingo as the `S` and `T` scales, for $sin$ and $tan$):

{{< figure src="CloseUpTrig.jpg" class="fig-wide">}}  

For the $sin$ and $tan$ scales, you place the cursor (the red marker) in the
degrees scale (the one from 10 to 90) and you read the sin of it on top. For
$tan$, you need to check the degrees in the spiraling scale in the center, and
read the $tan$ of the angle also on top.

### What's it good for?

Such a small circular slide rule has a fairly low precision (2 digits more or
less.) This essentially makes it pretty much useless for me, since I have more
or less the same precision in mental division or multiplication.

Anyway, I have used it several times when checking traffic numbers for websites,
when estimating daily visits from monthly or bimonthly numbers. Once you set the
number of days as ratio, it's pretty fast.


An interesting use would be for quick currency conversions while abroad (you fix
the ratio and can easily convert from currencies) but since I travel mostly in
Europe, I can't use it for this (Norway, Iceland, Great Britain and Denmark are
good targets still.)

People still use slide rules though:
[nomographs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) (what the sin and tan scales
are, actually) are a quick way to compute things, and are used in aviation,
electric engineering and other fields where speed is interesting and 5 digit
precision is not as important.
