**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links. Data engineering, software engineering, Python, work stuff, formal methods.

## [Randolph diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_diagram#Application_to_logic_theory)

I wanted to mention this in the [intro to my Wardley mapping talk](https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping), but couldn't find a way. It's interesting though.

## [How to do High-Bar Code Review Without Being a Jerk](https://andrewking.ca/2020/01/how-to-do-high-bar-code-review-without-being-a-jerk/)

Good, good.

## [Age of Invention: Where Be Dragons?](https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-where-be-dragons)

Why role playing games were not invented earlier? Dice and stories have existed since the beginning.

## [Five Interesting Data Engineering Projects](https://medium.com/@squarecog/five-interesting-data-engineering-projects-48ffb9c9c501)

I've been mentioning some of these (and tried some others already) for a while. Obviously an article that agrees with me is good.

## [The Most Annoying Corporate Buzzwords](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/most-annoying-corporate-buzzwords/606748/)

Let the Agile synergy be disrupted.

## [We Are All Ancient Mapmakers](http://nautil.us/issue/81/maps/we-are-all-ancient-mapmakers)

Not sure what it was about, but was entertaining, as any Nautilus article.

## [The Horrifically Dystopian World of Software Engineering Interviews](https://www.jarednelsen.dev/posts/The-horrifically-dystopian-world-of-software-engineering-interviews)

I've always hated "smart" problems with a passion… I don't think I'd make it (or even want to) through the interview hoops at _those_ companies

## [How This One Font Took Over the World](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/how-this-one-font-took-over-the-world)

No, it's not Comic Sans (or Helvetica).

## [State of Remote Work 2020](https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020)

A set of interviews yield some data. Here's the data (from Buffer).

## [Hallucinogenic fish - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic_fish)

Not much more to say. Puts fish stew in another, more colourful light.

## [Python '!=' Is Not 'is not': Comparing Objects in Python](https://realpython.com/python-is-identity-vs-equality/)

Nothing I was not aware of, but I always enjoy RealPython's writing on technical points.

## [Sharing an SQLite database across containers is surprisingly brilliant](https://medium.com/@rbranson/sharing-sqlite-databases-across-containers-is-surprisingly-brilliant-bacb8d753054)

How _Segment_ sped up its serving systems by using shared SQLite. Also opens up the idea of using SQLite files as _data interchange files_. Mentioned elsewhere (SQLite's docs?), using it to store machine learning models, for instance. Interesting, isn't it?

## [In Case You Ever Want to Unicycle 21,000 Miles…](https://www.outsideonline.com/2407533/unicycle-travel-gear)

I have a unicycle. Never used. Yet.

## [It's Official: Open-Plan Offices Are Now the Dumbest Management Fad of All Time](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/its-official-open-plan-offices-are-now-dumbest-management-fad-of-all-time.html)

I wrote about office stuff on a post on my [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/first-looking-effect-work-environments-productivity-rubén-berenguel/). This could be added to it.

## [The Best Board Games of the Ancient World](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/best-board-games-ancient-world-180974094/)

The expected classics. If you have never played Nine Men Morris (it's quite unknown in many places), give it a go, is quite fun. Also, Tablut/Hnefatafl varieties are super-fun (and good-looking). And Backgammon, a more "modern classic".

## [A Year’s Worth](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/a-years-worth-c1cbc3085e9d)

How do you visualise a year of work? Kent Beck recommends circles: they automatically create gaps you can't infinitely fill ([well… dependson what you work on](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Circle-Packing-%3A-A-Mathematical-Tale-Stephenson/729fef221b87bec213b7d36f415879a1056f9b55))

## [Master of Orion](https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/)

A dig through Master of Orion by *The Digital Antiquarian*. I played a lot of MoO2, so fun.

## [The man who discovered umami](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190503-the-mystery-taste-that-always-eluded-us)

I've been meaning to buy some MSG for some time now.

## [How an Optimizing Compiler Works](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/HowanOptimizingCompilerWorks.html)

Classic Li Haoyi quality here. He gave a talk on the subject in Scala Days 2019.

## [How knitters got knotted in a purity spiral](https://unherd.com/2020/01/cast-out-how-knitting-fell-into-a-purity-spiral/)

My partner is a pro knitter, and explained me these situations in real time (they were somehow close in time with some stuff happening in the Scala community I was explaining her). As I have said before, groups of humans always end up creating turmoil.

## [How To Take Smart Notes: 10 Principles to Revolutionize Your Note-Taking and Writing](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/)

Having a go at a Zettelkasten. I have been a pretty consistent note taker for many years, but getting knowledge/new ideas from them is hard. Let's see.

## [Pablo Escobar's hippos have become an invasive species in Colombia](https://www.cnet.com/news/pablo-escobars-hippos-have-become-an-invasive-species-in-colombia/)

This title has everything to deserve being here, even if the article was empty.

## [The Woman Shaking Up the Diamond Industry](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/03/the-woman-shaking-up-the-diamond-industry)

It's a suprisingly interesting and profoundly dull read. I can't wrap my head around these conflicting emotions. Caveat emptor.

## [How Pi Connects Colliding Blocks to a Quantum Search Algorithm](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-pi-connects-colliding-blocks-to-a-quantum-search-algorithm-20200121/)

[Pi is everywhere](/2010/08/and-e-appears-from-nowhere.html/), but the quantum connection is interesting

## [Today I Learned That Not Everyone Has An Internal Monologue And It Has Ruined My Day](https://ryanandrewlangdon.wordpress.com/2020/01/28/today-i-learned-that-not-everyone-has-an-internal-monologue-and-it-has-ruined-my-day/)

_Wait what?_

## [RIP Pipenv: Tried Too Hard. Do what you need with pip-tools](https://medium.com/telnyx-engineering/rip-pipenv-tried-too-hard-do-what-you-need-with-pip-tools-d500edc161d4)

I tried `pipenv`. Liked parts, hated many. Eyeing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for the next stuff.

## [The Business Case for Formal Methods](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/business-case-formal-methods)

How about finding bugs before you even write the code? Isn't that appealing?

## [Lean Coffee Facilitator’s Guide](https://medium.com/agile-outside-the-box/lean-coffee-facilitator-s-guide-d79d9f13d0a9)

The lean coffee framework seems super interesting, and I need to gather a few friends and do one soon.
