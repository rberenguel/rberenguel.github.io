Update on read books this year, I had forgotten on my previous posts.

## [Levels of code in Forth programing](http://www.ultratechnology.com/levels.htm)
The "first" approach sounded very hexagonal to me

## [Tokyo subwayâ€™s humble duct-tape typographer](https://medium.com/@chrisgaul/tokyo-subways-humble-duct-tape-typographer-a8c84bb6b99b)

Ductography.

## [Yes silver bullet](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/07/01/yes-silver-bullet/)

A partial disagreement with Brooks' famous [No silver bullet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) essay. I don't fully agree with either premise. Somewhat silver bullet?

## [Normal number - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number)

Don't know why I looked this up yesterday night in Wikipedia (I already knew what a normal number is, so what was the point?)

## [Data Catalogue â€” Knowing your data](https://medium.com/albert-franzi/data-catalogue-knowing-your-data-15f7d0724900)

Here [Albert](https://mobile.twitter.com/FranziCros) introduces us to Datahub, which looks like a fine solution for data discovery. I had tried Marquez a few months ago, and left unimpressed, so this is nudging me towards trying Datahub.

## [Nothing Compares to Yuzu](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/kitchen-notes/nothing-compares-to-yuzu)

Well, the fancy restaurant probably has yuzu in something. And shouldn't that be a 2?

## [Mapping coronavirus, responsibly](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/mapping/mapping-coronavirus-responsibly/)

A very good post about how toâ€¦ well, map responsibly.

## [Category Theory at Chartboost](https://engineering.chartboost.com/category-theory-at-chartboost-b2d35261fe1d)

I'd be slightly afraid of the speed penalty final tagless encodings can give. Not huge, but in general it's easier to write fast imperative than fast functional.

## [To Get Good, Go After The Metagame](https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/)

This was surprisingly insightful.

## [Stop Using Lists for Everything in Python](https://medium.com/better-programming/stop-using-lists-for-everything-in-python-46fad15217f4)

Water is wet and tuples are useful. If you find what you read here interesting and unknown, look up __slots__.

## [Survival of the Mediocre Mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/04/24/survival-of-the-mediocre-mediocre/)

Another unclassifyable but insightful post. And the Douglas Adams and Star Trek:TNG references are spot-on.

## ðŸ”Š [Every Tool's a Hammer: Life is what you make it](https://www.amazon.com/Every-Tools-Hammer-Life-What/dp/1982113472/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=XAR2S87JR9J6&keywords=every+tool's+a+hammer&qid=1583004928&sprefix=every+tool',aps,228&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=7cfb90bd0a0686424affd1ba50bc2f95&language=en_US)
Strange book by Mysthbusters' Adam Savage. Not sure how I'd classify it, but it was entertaining

## ðŸ“š [How to take smart notes: one simple technique to boost writing, learning and thinking](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=how+to+take+smart+notes&qid=1583004993&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=8485b9ea1634772920698cf3f78262c2&language=en_US)
Boy that's a long title. Basically introduces you to Luhmann's [Zettelkasten](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (Entschuldigung). It's not an easy read, and I'd say it misses the "how to use it" part. The concept itself, though, is very interesting.

## ðŸ“š [Accelerate: Building and Scaling High-Performing Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=2TGGZ3KBAWDOJ&keywords=accelerate+forsgren&qid=1583005040&sprefix=accelerate+for,aps,265&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=3f07dec692aca700ab99fe2d46bcc59e&language=en_US)
Read it at the beginning of the year, it's basically a must read at this point. 

## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters Iâ€™m subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog.
