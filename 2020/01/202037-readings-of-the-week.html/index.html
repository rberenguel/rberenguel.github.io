<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This week is more of a hodgepodge. There is Python and data engineering, Haskell… And the rest feels hard to classify as a whole. I hope you enjoy regardless. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the <a href="https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek">tag here</a>. You can also get these as a weekly newsletter by subscribing <a href="http://eepurl.com/geFw7P">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also note that there are no books read, surprisingly: the reason is that I stopped any books I was in the middle of reading and started with a fresh &ldquo;want to read&rdquo; list for 2020 (which happens to have 20+1 books). It&rsquo;s still to early for any to be finished (first may be in next week&rsquo;s edition).</p>

<p>I didn’t learn anything from the history, but it was interesting to see every step in its historical context, and be reminded I should read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Dynamics-Jay-Wright-Forrester/dp/0262060264/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=urban+dynamics&amp;qid=1578771215&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkId=d046c9d51c668ab6b5e407a14c59afbb&amp;language=en_US">Urban Dynamics</a>, has been on my reading list for 2 years.</p>

<p>This was mentioned above, and since I wasn’t aware of the concept, found this article. So interesting! A way of anchoring what you really want to measure (the <em>concept</em>) with more than one metric to prevent drift in unwanted directions.</p>

<p>Long, but worth it. If you remember, CGA was a 4-colour display mode of yore, improved upon by EGA (16) and VGA (256). Well, there are always surprises… And in this demo they show how to get to <em>1024</em> colours in CGA. That would have been batshit crazy in 1980.</p>

<p>The result is pretty impressive: a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> (text-based) neural network is trained on chess game transcriptions. <em>Only</em>. By <em>just</em> guessing next “words” it can play chess at a… level. With no knowledge of rules, or even what the board might look like. I’m out of words to describe how fascinating this is.</p>

<p>I read this one early-ish last year, but for some reason it didn’t make it into any <em>Weekly Readings</em>. Maybe it was before I started? Not sure. In any case, looks like an interesting way of journaling. Although I enjoy drawing and diagramming and all that, I’m more of a writing person for journals.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/marcraminv">Marc</a> recommended this talk a few days ago, and my first reaction was &ldquo;The Lisp guy?&rdquo; And yes, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston">Patrick Winston</a>. It&rsquo;s excellent. I disagree on a couple things on ending presentations, but that&rsquo;s a personal take.</p>
