Skipped last week `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯` This week has more machine learning than usual for no special reason. Posting this at 4 AM because for some reason I could not sleep and decided I may as well finish this.

<!--more-->

**NOTE**: More machine learning, some Python and the usual mixers. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag here](https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek). You can also get these as a weekly newsletter by subscribing [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).

## [Eunoia: Words that Don't Translate](https://eunoia.world/)

No words to describe it

## [Ask HN: What do top engineers you know do that others don't?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21870889)

There are many interesting _Ask HN_ posts. Like this one.

## [Getting started with giotto-learn](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-giotto-learn-a-python-library-for-topological-machine-learning-451d88d2c4bc)

Topological features... ðŸ¤”

## [GPT-2 As a step toward general intelligence](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/19/gpt-2-as-step-toward-general-intelligence/)

> The brain isnâ€™t directly doing math, itâ€™s creating a model that includes math and somehow doing the math in the model. This is hilariously perverse.

## [Agar Art Contest 2019](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/11/agar-art-contest-winners-create-gorgeous-art-from-live-bacteria/)

Uh.

## [Are Daily Scrum meetings worth it?](https://blog.valuemotive.com/are-daily-scrum-meetings-worth-it-6c6fb915bec4)

If they are done properly, why not? I suspect this heading violates [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines).

## [Here Dragons Abound: New Mountain Style](https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/01/new-mountain-style-part-7.html)

I always enjoy checking this blog.

## [Advertising Makes Us Unhappy](https://hbr.org/2020/01/advertising-makes-us-unhappy)

I wonder if the effect is higher for people working in the field.

## [Add to weekly readings How we made Captain Planet and the Planeteers](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/20/how-we-made-captain-planet-and-the-planeteers)

This was a classic of my childhood, in Catalan in TV3.

## [Measure Code Execution Time Accurately in Python](https://knasmueller.net/measure-code-execution-time-accurately-in-python)

Interesting! Accounting for the systemic error in measuring _function calls_.

## [A sad day for Rust](https://words.steveklabnik.com/a-sad-day-for-rust)

There is a constant noise about how "bad, toxic" the Scala community is, and I always point out that all programming language communities have issues, because they are formed by humans. This does not mean we can't improve, but that saying "your community is worse and you should leave it" is not a productive way of treating the issue.

## [Google plans to kill off third-party cookies in Chrome 'within 2 years'](https://digiday.com/media/google-plans-kill-off-third-party-cookies-chrome-within-2-years/)

SameSite took around the same amount of time. So not sure we can trust this timeline

## [BlackRock Has Green Plans](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-14/blackrock-has-green-plans)

Beware, Bloomberg's paywall is strong. An analysis by Matt Levine about BlackRock's letter to greenify.

## [How we reduced our Apache Spark cluster cost using best practices](https://medium.com/iotransportation/how-we-reduced-our-apache-spark-cluster-cost-using-best-practices-ac1f176379ac)

Nothing in this list should surprise you. If it does, ping me.

## [Virtual DOM is pure overhead](https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead)

I rarely touch Javascript, but I keep an eye. Svelte seems to be gaining mindshare/generating more noise

## [Toyota (music instruments) tweet](https://twitter.com/leemakiyama/status/1216664221951373312?s=20)

Just a tweet. Won't comment

## [Interior Design](http://www.jamesfriedmanphotographer.com/projects/thumbnails/4)

6 iron planets

## [A Burning Nation, Led By Cowards](https://blog.usejournal.com/a-burning-nation-led-by-cowards-c7bc620ca0c0)

Very sad read about the land down under.

## [A Big Little Idea Called Legibility](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/)

Simplification can lead you astray (this is _not_ about code legibility)

## [The Mechanical Muse](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-mechanical-muse)

> Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud

## [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/)

The issue should be with the actions, not the result. Also, clean code should be easy to extend. Don't throw the baby with the bath water and all that.




## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
