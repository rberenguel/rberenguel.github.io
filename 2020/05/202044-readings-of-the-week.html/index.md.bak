The lack of commute is _very_ hard on my reading, and I have also been working on several projects that have eaten into my reading/writing time.

<!--more-->

Sorry for the delay. I have been working on [several](https://github.com/rberenguel/motllo) [personal](https://github.com/rberenguel/bear-note-graph) [projects](https://github.com/rberenguel/paque) and this has eaten on my reading and writing time. I can't promise I'll come back to weekly posts, at the moment I'm having fun with [generative coding](https://github.com/rberenguel/sketches) in the afternoons, which is where I did most of my reading.

**NOTE**: Apache Spark, engineering, management, remote working, art‚Ä¶ A lot of subjects since it covers almost a full month of varied reading. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag here](https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek). You can also get these as a weekly newsletter by subscribing [here](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P).

## [Stretching exercises - Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)](https://www.rsipain.com/stretching-exercises.php)

## [Comment Only What the Code Cannot Say](https://medium.com/@kevlinhenney/comment-only-what-the-code-cannot-say-dfdb7b8595ac)

My approach. Code should be readable. Only comment if you really, really need a comment.

## [Spotify‚Äôs Failed #SquadGoals](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/)

Huh, it makes sense, and is unexpected at the same time.

## [What the heck is pyproject.toml?](https://snarky.ca/what-the-heck-is-pyproject-toml/)

## [Quarantine work is not Remote work](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/QuarantineWorkIsNotRemoteWork.aspx)

Every week we have a "team sanity check meeting" and I always mention how tired I am since lockdown started. I am used to working remotely (8 or 9 years already) but this is not a normal situation.

## [Blurred rounded rectangles](https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/2020/04/21/blurred-rounded-rects.html)

This is like too much information on how to do this.

It feels like a magic illusion, holding the whole of the colours. Worth mentioning [Shades of Grey](https://www.amazon.com/Shades-of-Grey/dp/B006N0FBHI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1589114070&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=3f2ce73ba10cd010ef5d0d851c2f2f85&language=en_US) here. One of my favourite books, and at the moment of this writing heavily discounted on Kindle.

## [Mac: How to find cause of high kernel_task cpu usage? - Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/363337/how-to-find-cause-of-high-kernel-task-cpu-usage/363933#363933)

## [Animated Multi-Julia Sets with Finite Precision](https://weigert.vsos.ethz.ch/2020/04/14/animated-multi-julia-sets/)

## [üçø Introducci√≥n a la programaci√≥n funcional con ZIO - YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i0nOJyGfyzI)

## [üìö Difficult conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters-ebook/dp/B004CR6ALA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=3OVYXIL3209GN&dchild=1&keywords=difficult+conversations&qid=1589115095&sprefix=difficult+conversations,aps,280&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=97e37146b570ba7d57b0744082856166&language=en_US)

A classic, but everything sounds like NVC without mentioning NVC.

## [Conway's Prime-Producing Machine](https://www.futilitycloset.com/2010/06/27/conways-prime-producing-machine/)

A Fractran algorithm

## [Amazon Redshift CI/CD‚Ää-‚ÄäHow we did it and why you should do it¬†too](https://medium.com/big-data-engineering/redshift-cicd-how-we-did-it-and-why-you-should-do-it-to-e46ecf734eab)

Not sure about running on Redshift   Otherwise wo do sqlite

Looks awesome, but pricewise out of reality

## [üçø SQL databases come up with algorithms you‚Äôd never have dreamed of (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTPGW1PNy_Y)

Watched a while ago so I no longer remember much more than "I should read more on database internals"

## [PEP 544 -- Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/)

Huh, I missed this. Interesting way to improve my Python

## [We released simdjson 0.3: the fastest JSON parser in the world is even better! ](https://lemire.me/blog/2020/03/31/we-released-simdjson-0-3-the-fastest-json-parser-in-the-world-is-even-better/)

Sadly it sounds like it wouldn't help in one usecase we have, newline separated JSONs (where the win would be marginal). But I will try at some point.

## [A Developer's Guide to Surviving the Coronapocalypse ](http://degoes.net/articles/coronapocalypse)

Kind of pairs well with Stealing the Corner Office

## [üìö Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work](https://www.amazon.com/Decisive-Make-Better-Choices-Life/dp/B00B3Z5QFK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=CWSNRMS3AGSH&dchild=1&keywords=decisive+by+chip+and+dan+heath&qid=1589115381&s=books&sprefix=decisive,aps,256&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=1e72f081a6bbacb9e038ac2f12bf8444&language=en_US)

This was super-interesting, as the large amount of notes I kept say. How to take decisions, basically. A framework you may use.

## [The Invention of the AeroPress](https://priceonomics.com/the-invention-of-the-aeropress/)

I don't know how I found this. For my birthday, I got a [Cafflano Kompresso](https://www.amazon.com/Cafflano-Kompresso-Carry-Coffee-Maker/dp/B074TRBKW4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=29PFCKFUWB5PE&dchild=1&keywords=cafflano+kompresso&qid=1589115485&sprefix=cafflano,aps,273&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=c5edcc085b10b7b10032665de5ed5cb9&language=en_US) (kind of a fancier, better, Aeropress, rendering a very good espresso) so it may be due to that.
