The full lockdown edition. Almost no engineering `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`. The lack of commute is hard on reading articles.

My back rejoices, I [got a new chair](https://www.amazon.com/Varier-Variable-Original-Kneeling-Designed/dp/B06XXP15CW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=varier+balans&qid=1585398880&sr=8-7&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=ab1a42fae9dcca076dc1b7d7a6789c9c&language=en_US)!

**NOTE**: Apache Spark, engineering and a lot of remote working. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well.

## [Executing Spark code with expr and eval ](https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/expr-eval/)

Feels a bit like cheating, and is using a semi-private interface (`expr`) but for quick spark-shell explorations looks excellent.

## [Fast subsets of large datasets with Pandas and SQLite](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/indexing-pandas-sqlite/)

Technically, you could have stayed with the SQLite part. You can load CSV files directly into SQLite with the directives `.mode csv` and `.import filename tablename` from within the SQLite CLI client.

## [What's the Point of Applicative?](http://www.doscienceto.it/blog/posts/2020-03-24-applicative.html)

Not for newbies to the weird functional world, but very well explained.

## [A Light Box in Heavy Times](https://blog.afandian.com/2020/02/light-box-heavy-times/)

Damn impressive DIY project. At least for me, I'm really bad with electronics.

## [Trunk Based Development](https://mrdevops.io/trunk-based-development-8376fe577c11)

I can see how this could work very well. Usually I am for a "I can deploy at any time with no hassle", but getting to trunk based requires a level of testing not everybody is "happy" with.

## [Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking And More](https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/)

When you work in adtech, you need to stay up in adtech stuff. Webkit is always at the forefront of privacy, by the way.

## [Mise en Place Writing](https://www.swyx.io/writing/writing-mise-en-place/)

Don't just write, but plan.

## [The secret field that nobody will tell you about](https://chittur.dev/math/2019/12/05/secret-field.html)

Neat walk through in the creation of a field extension of the rationals.

## [üçø Picking Up Glowing Hot Space Shuttle Tiles with Bare Hands](https://kottke.org/20/03/picking-up-glowing-hot-space-shuttle-tiles-with-bare-hands)

Wow, that's some slow termal transfer there.

## [üçø Q&A with a person who does not have an internal monologue](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u69YSh-cFXY&feature=youtu.be)

I've shared previously the no-monologue post, here's an interview.

## [Helsinki Bus Station Theory](http://www.fotocommunity.com/info/Helsinki_Bus_Station_Theory)

Unrelated to the content of the post, but I have actually been in that station.

## [Rare Andean bears flock to cloud forest to feast on wild avocados | Environment | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/21/rare-andean-bears-flock-to-cloud-forest-to-feast-on-wild-avocados-aoe)

This headline was so good I had to add it.

## [Here Dragons Abound: Creating a Pencil Effect in SVG](https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/creating-pencil-effect-in-svg.html)

It's not the first time I share something from _Here dragons abound_ and it won't be the last.

## [Happy Hour Goes Online as Coronavirus Forces Everyone Inside](https://www.wsj.com/articles/happy-hour-goes-online-as-coronavirus-forces-everyone-inside-11584735297)

Blending social drinking with drinking alone

## [Identifying Bot Commenters on Reddit using Benford‚Äôs Law ](https://diybigdata.net/2020/03/using-benfords-law-to-identify-bots-on-reddit/)

Benford's law (a certain distribution of leading digits in naturally occuring sequences) can detect some cases of fraud, although it always feels like cheating a bit.

## [Recursive SQL Queries with PostgreSQL](https://towardsdatascience.com/recursive-sql-queries-with-postgresql-87e2a453f1b)

The first step to understand recursion is to understand recursion.

## [Work in the Time of Corona](https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/work-in-the-time-of-corona/)

These are interesting times, and remote working is here now for everybody. I have worked remotely or semi-remotely for more than 10 years, so it's not new for me. You may find interesting things here though.

## [This Extremely Chill Landscape Was Drawn in Pure Code](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3me3b/this-extremely-chill-landscape-was-drawn-in-pure-code)

I'm more of a Peter Griffin styled CSS user, so this blows my mind

{{< figure src="PeterGriffinVsCSS.gif" class="fig-not-so-wide">}}

## [Bending the Curves of Productivity](https://fortelabs.co/blog/bending-the-curves-of-productivity)

This is a very interesting classification of productivity methods

## [Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/?fbclid=IwAR24L_ubdg_hO8qqd9AhvHVmPyedCJ0fj4ZPgiA_IEMBmaX5ipSsFZ63ahY)

Won't surprise anybody at this point, but this was written early enough. Most countries could have done _more_ *earlier*.
