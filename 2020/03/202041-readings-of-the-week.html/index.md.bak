No specific theme this week, but feels more data engineering heavy than lately. As it should. Oh, and beware door knobs, they can bring evil.

<!--more-->

**NOTE**: The themes are varied, and some links below are affiliate links. Apache Spark, category theory, Scala, Python, data engineering, engineering management. Expect a similar wide range in the future as well. You can check all my weekly readings by checking the [tag here](https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/ReadingsOfTheWeek).

## [Coronavirus: the second-weirdest solution?](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4664)

Maybe some kind of mental training can work.

## [Enhance Your Databricks Workflow](https://menziess.github.io/howto/enhance/your-databricks-workflow/)

We've been using Databricks for some time now. I'm more in the Scala side than
the Python side, but if we decide to start writing jobs mostly in Python, I'll
keep this post in mind.

## [When Bloom filters don't bloom](https://blog.cloudflare.com/when-bloom-filters-dont-bloom/)

I think a Bloom filter didn't fit the problem too well from the start, but I
guess I'm biased because I have read the article. Hindsight is so 2020.

## [Loading NumPy arrays from disk: mmap() vs. Zarr/HDF5](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/mmap-vs-zarr-hdf5/)

I don't think I have ever been in a position where I have needed such speed, but
I'll keep this in mind.

## [AWS unit tests with localstack and scalatest](https://gist.github.com/kag0/d0e601195f2d06e74f2675a36d68fb07)

This is a code gist. Worth starring if you understand what the subject is about.

## [Prevent Repetition with Assignment Expressions](https://effectivepython.com/2020/02/02/prevent-repetition-with-assignment-expressions)

The infamous walrus from Python. Oh, Python simplicity of yore, where thou
hidst?

## [Hit the mute button: why everyone is trying to silence the outside world](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/12/hit-mute-button-why-everyone-trying-to-silence-outside-world-uber)

Active Noise Cancelling (or Control) is a rising business. Typed while wearing
[Bowers & Wilkins' PX7s](https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Bluetooth-Headphone-Cancelling/dp/B07WK5XT8T/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=bowers+wilkins&qid=1583592562&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rbersblog-20&linkId=704e3589ececc58dbf877884689f3160&language=en_US) set at _high_.

## [A Vaccine Wonâ€™t Stop the New Coronavirus - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/covid-vaccine/607000/)

We can only expect to slow down the spread so that health systems can cope with
most people getting ill.

## [Typed functional Dependency Injection in Python](https://sobolevn.me/2020/02/typed-functional-dependency-injection)

I hate dependency _injection_. Or at least, magic DI frameworks that don't state
explicitly what is going on.

## [BFG & Muddy Waters - Billy F Gibbons of ZZ Top](https://billygibbons.com/2017/06/bfg-muddy-waters/)

I don't remember how I found this article. Probably the harmonica roots of Muddy
Waters and the fun looks of ZZ Top made me read it, and it wasn't wasted.

## [The prisonerâ€™s dilemma at 70 â€“ at what we get wrong about it](http://timharford.com/2020/02/the-prisoners-dilemma-at-70-at-what-we-get-wrong-about-it/)

From Tim Harford. I found slightly weird that he mentioned climate change as an
example of the Prisoner's Dilemma, for me it's one of the best examples of
Tragedy of the Commons. Maybe there is something I can't see there.

## [Reorder JOIN optimizer - cost-based optimization](https://www.waitingforcode.com/apache-spark-sql/reorder-join-optimizer-cost-based-optimization/read)

An overview (with code and examples) of how the join optimiser in Apache Spark
uses CBO.

## [Down on the Farm That Harvests Metal From Plants](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/science/metal-plants-farm.html)

Beware the NY Times Great Paywall. The article is super interesting though.

## [Product vs. Feature Teams](https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/)

There is something vaguely depressing about this post and I can't put my finger
on what or where.

## [Five principles that will keep your data warehouse organized](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/five-principles-that-will-keep-your-data-warehouse-organized-9c3d29caf6ce)

From the creators of [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com). Good rules.

## [On editing text](https://bosker.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/on-editing-text/)

A categorical approach to text editing. It's unexpected.

## [ðŸ”Š Matt Rocklin - Parallel Computing & Founding OSS Companies (PyData Deep Dive podcast)](https://overcast.fm/+UQGuZE2Us)

I've been interested in Dask for some time now (wow, closing in toâ€¦ 3 years?).
This is a good chat about it.

## [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/geFw7P)?
These weekly posts are also available as a newsletter. These days (since RSS went into limbo) most of my regular information comes from several newsletters Iâ€™m subscribed to, instead of me going directly to a blog.
