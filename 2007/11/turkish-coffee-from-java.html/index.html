<p>I have used it to make me some turkish coffee. The procedure is easy, and the result can be really good.</p>

<ol>
<li>Grind the coffee several times, as it must be the finer the better.</li>
<li>Put 2 and a half cups of cold mineral water in a narrow and tall heater (the taller and narrower the better, the best would be a cevze)</li>

<li><p>Add 2 and a half teaspoons of sugar and stir it well.</p></li>

<li><p>Add the coffee to the water, spreading it evenly over the surface of the water.</p></li>

<li><p>Heat slowly.</p></li>

<li><p>When it starts to foam, stop the stove and stir carefully to keep some foam.</p></li>

<li><p>Heat again until foaming starts, stop the stove and stir again.</p></li>

<li><p>Repeat one last time.</p></li>

<li><p>Wait 30 seconds for the coffee to settle.</p></li>

<li><p>Take some foam with a spoon and put it on each cup, add then some coffee to them keeping in mind that you can&rsquo;t put all (as there is a lot of mold at the bottom).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The (blurred) result:</p>
