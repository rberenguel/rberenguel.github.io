<p>I talked on monday afternoon, but my talk was a mess. I rushed through it in 10 minuts, when my alloted time was of 25&hellip; It was the same talk I gave on September as my Master&rsquo;s thesis (i.e. DEA) defense, so I knew too well what I was talking about. And THIS was the problem, I saw it too easily. Next time I&rsquo;ll write a new set of slides every time.</p>
