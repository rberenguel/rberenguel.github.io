And after two weeks of almost continued use, I like it even more than when I decided to use it. Some of the points I really enjoy (in no particular order).</p>

<li>Strong keyboard shortcuts. As an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">emacs</a> junkie as I am, I love keyboard shortcuts. And <a href="http://www.fluxbox.org/">Fluxbox</a> is incredibly flexible in defining or removing them: Even system-wide shortcuts are customizable. And avoiding the use of the trackpad (if it were as good as a Macbook one, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind, but it&rsquo;s not the case) is a big point. Now I have keyboard shortcuts, usually Windows key (I found something useful to do with it!) and a letter (i.e. WK+e for emacs, WK+f for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>) or Control+Windows key+letter, if it has already been defined (WK+p is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin_%28software%29">Pidgin</a>, and C+WK+p is gnome-screenshot).<br />

<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Desktop&rdquo; level applications. One of the first additions I got in Fluxbox was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conky_%28software%29">conky</a>, a system monitor, which sits in your root window: your &ldquo;desktop&rdquo;. I always put it around quotation marks, as I think a desktop without files sounds strange&hellip; But I don&rsquo;t mind anymore: I mapped Shift+F11 (in the same vein as I have F11 for show desktop in my Mac) to open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_%28file_manager%29">Nautilus</a>, this way I don&rsquo;t even recall missing it. But the point is that any application can be &ldquo;rooted&rdquo; by changing its default layer, and saving the configuration (right click, or whatever you have configured in the window&rsquo;s pane, select remember, switch on the desired features and then &ldquo;save on close&rdquo;): this way every time you issue the &lsquo;ShowDesktop&rsquo; command (which I set up as Shift-F12) you also see the rooted application. In my case, I have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aterm">aterm</a> with pseudotransparent background and without window decorations.<br />

<ol>
<li><p>Window decoration easy removal. WK+t toggles WindowDecoration on and off. And you can set a window to remember its last state&hellip; so my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">terminal</a> applications and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">emacs</a> no longer have window decoration. Saving screen real estate is a point, and more so in netbooks. But if I were to need it, just a keypress and it is there again. Together with auto-hide of the <a href="http://www.fluxbox.org/features/">Toolbar</a>, I get extra screen height available.</p></li>

<li><p>Tabs. I started to use tabs very recently. In short, you can group two (or any number, in fact) &ldquo;windows&rdquo; in one &ldquo;big window&rdquo;, by drag-drop of the window pane of one into another while pressing WK (usually it is mapped to using the middle mouse button, but I don&rsquo;t have one, naturally). And switch from one to another indepently of the rest of the system. I use it among &ldquo;related&rdquo; tasks, for instance my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin_%28software%29">Pidgin</a> chat window and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">emacs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evince">evince</a>), this way WK+tab switches between just these two tasks, and if I want to go away (emacs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_%28file_manager%29">Nautilus</a>&hellip; any other open window) I just alt-tab once and get to the next. Obviously there are also numerical shortcuts for any tab: WK+1 takes you to tab one, and so on. I know, the way I use it is more or less like Alt-Tabbing&hellip; but it doesn&rsquo;t exactly feel the same: I don&rsquo;t have to backtab. I will be using it more and more, probably as I love this feature.</p></li>
