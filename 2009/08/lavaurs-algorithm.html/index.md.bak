These days I've been busy programming a version of Lavaurs algorithm for the
idenfication of circle chords: the abstract Mandelbrot set.

The images don't look like much, but the output of the program is nicer: it
outputs an Encapsulated PostScript file which looks sharper. But when converting
to `png` with ImageMagick some distortion appeared.

You can get the black and white depth 13 PostScript file here
[here](BWLavaurs13.eps), and the color
version [here](ColorLavaurs13.eps).

The code is a set of Lisp functions, with
the main one being recursive. I also have a double-recursive version, but the
first time I used it I thought I had a problem with the code, and rewrote it.
It did work, but it is slower. The output is a set of orthogonal circles to
a main one, set as "clip" in the PostScript file.

<span class="scaps">Note from 2019:</span>A few months after I wrote this post
and code, [Adam Majewski](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Adam_majewski)
rewrote big chunks of my Lisp code (with my blessing), making it faster and
cleaner. You can read about it, and about the Lavaurs algorithm in [this
wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Mandelbrot_set/lavaurs).
Nowadays you can find many implementations of Lavaurs chords, back when I wrote
mine I think it was the only one freely/easily available. I have recovered my
original code (unmodified, for my modern shame), you can find it in this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/rberenguel/384292c739172df8e2f530297e7b50f4).

I am increasingly happier of my last [Christmas postcard &
tutorial](/2008/12/quick-postscript-programming-tutorial.html), as they forced
me to learn PostScript programming. Turns out to be more useful than I thought.
