I have finally finished (duh!) reading a book on shorthand ([stenography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenography)) focused on the catalan language. It is a book by Josep Cormand, "Estudi de fonologia bàsica : Mètode d'escriptura ràpida", ISBN 84-218-0320-4. It is based in a method developed by professor Dalmau, based on catalan fonology. Once you are able to write in this way, you enjoy it more and more, is quite an interesting feeling. Although I find re-reading what I wrote a pain... I have written a lot more than read, thus I am still far from being proficient at it.
