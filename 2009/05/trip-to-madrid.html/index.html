<p>Last weekend we had a quick trip (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) to Madrid. Being a Barcelona lover, I thought I would hate the city. I was amazed after walking over there, having a look at all the monuments and museums (the tourist thing), and then going for dinner and supper, some tapas and a beer. Madrid surprised us with this&hellip; in Barcelona is quite hard to find a cheap and good place to eat&hellip; or not so cheap, but not tourist focused. I guess Madrid is made more for the people that live there than the tourists that come. And it is easier to feel the difference than I thought.</p>
