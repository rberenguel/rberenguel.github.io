<p><a href="http://jbrink.net/ttpro/index.html">TouchTerm Pro</a> (6.99€): A terminal application, developed for iPod/iPhone. It is great, although it has so many options, and gesture commands I am still learning. Steep learning curve, but I have used it to see if the programs I&rsquo;m running are over, and merging images from the command line. A must, but depends if you do something on terminals.</p>

The feeling is almost as good as pen and paper, and the range of tools is mindblowing. Here is an overview of the application, with a promotional video at the end: <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/technology/autodesk_puts_the_fun_in_your_pocket_introducing_sketchbook_mobile_14649.asp">Autodesk puts the fun in your pocket: Introducing Sketchbook Mobile</a>.</p>
