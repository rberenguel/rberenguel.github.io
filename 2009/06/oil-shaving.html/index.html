<p>I found this idea in a Slashdot history, and tried at home. Every time I had tried to shave smoother (by doing several passes, as just one was too spiky), I ended with either red itchy skin (and not really smooth), or the same with little scars, bleeding.</p>

<p>Olive oil allows me to make any number of passes, without red skin (a little blood, but it is not a problem if the skin feels good). But the first pass hurts as hell, beware. Then it gets softer and smoother. I repeat between 2 and 4 times, and then get a really hot shower. I don&rsquo;t put any soap or anything to clean the oily face, I just let the high pressure hot water clean it. Also, the bubbly water falling from my hair sure helps clearing without irritation.</p>

<p>Afterwards, be sure to have some soap nearby, to clear the oil spilling in your sink.</p>
