This evening I was bored at home, and decided to have a look at my old Lisp
raytracerâ€¦ a project that just went idle a year ago. I picked up another
programming project I had idling for a long time (an emacs lisp project, to
interact with my [console-based fractal drawer](/2009/02/douady-rabbit.html)s).
I had a coding breakthrough that time, and managed to advance quite a bit in a
little time, so today I tried again.
  
Well, I corrected the plane cutting problems, although the intersection code is
still buggy (numerical problems) and messy (hard as hell to read). I have to
undergo a complete rewritting of the scene system soon, and add textures for
[FSM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastafarian)'s sake! After that, add (again)
refraction code and finally, if all goes well, I shall add also a triangle mesh
loader, someday. When the time is right I'll post the source code as well.
