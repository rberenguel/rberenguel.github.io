[Stephen Wolfram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) (owner of [Wolfram Research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Research)) has released (after announcing it in March) [Wolfram Alpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Alpha), a kind of web search aimed at natural language and intelligent answers. [JME](http://ripero.wordpress.com/) pointed me to this question:

The strange thing about it is that is is fully written in Mathematica (or so
they say, 5 million lines of code). Strange indeed, Mathematica isn't a
particularly fast or "comfy" programming language. I bet someone could write a
LISP version of it in half that lines... without word-wrapping ;)
