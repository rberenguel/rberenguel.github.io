As you may already know, I presented a [poster](/docs/20101009-PosterWarsaw.jpg)
at a conference recently, and did the set up with [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net), the texts with LaTeX
with the Beamer and [Beamerposter](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamerposter?lang=en) packages.

{{< figure src="scribus.jpg" class="fig-wide" caption="Setting up">}}

<span class="scaps">Note from 2019</span>: I can't find the final version of
that poster, only a modified version from a few months later for another conference.

The first piece of advise, is to set page guides where needed (in the _Page_ menu,
you can put them at a certain numerical place, and then move them along) and
then _Snap to guides_ in the same menu. This way, you can move everything into the
correct place and align perfectly. The second advice, is to work with low
resolution and image visible settings for embedded images. In my poster, everything
except the main title were embedded images (`PS` for the `LaTeX` output, `PNG` for the
images), thus the draw time was really long. I also sett the DPI of all non-PS
images at at least 400. I wanted a nice print.

The code for the slide-like blocks is the following:

```latex
\\documentclass\[slidestop,compress\]{beamer} 
\\usepackage\[orientation=portrait,size=custom, width=25, height=8, debug\]{beamerposter} 
\\usepackage{beamerthemeshadow} 
\\usepackage{beamerouterthemedefault} 
\\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsthm} 
\\usenavigationsymbolstemplate{} 
\\usepackage\[latin1\]{inputenc} 
\\usepackage\[catalan\]{babel} 
\\usetheme{Copenhagen}\\usetheme{Copenhagen} 
\\begin{document} 
\\begin{frame}\[plain\] 
\\begin{block}{Block title} 
Content of block 
\\end{block} 
\\end{frame} 
\\end{document}
```

This setup generates just a "block piece", which could also be a `Theorem` piece
(if you have already Beamer-ized something you know what I mean). You need to
generate as many .tex files as "pieces" in your poster, and then generate
`Postscript` files for them. In the current version of Scribus, it is better to
use Postscript files and the Postscrit filter to PDF export than embedding
PDF's. At least in my triesâ€¦, I guess they will solve it soon.
