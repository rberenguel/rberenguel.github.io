What could I say about this movie? Definitely the best science fiction film of all time. A funny sentence Leon said Deckard before dying:  
  

**Leon:**

My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?

**Deckard:**

Four years.

**Leon:**

More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.

**Deckard:**

Oh, I agree.

**Leon:**

Wake up! Time to die.
