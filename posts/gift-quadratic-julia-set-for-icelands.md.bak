Today is Iceland's National Day (commemorating their independence day and the date of birth of Jón Sigurðsson), and to commemorate it I share this image with everyone.  
  
I computed this image a long, long time ago (using the Distance Estimator Method, paralellised with PVM using 16 computers, it took just 2 minutes). The full file is a 30MB pdf, which I printed large-size, and sits in my office. This is for your desktop background pleasure, I hope you enjoy it. I can do higher resolution shots or zooms from the original if you like.
