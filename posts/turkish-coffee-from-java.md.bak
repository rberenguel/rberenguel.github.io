A month or so ago I went to [Cafes El Magn√≠fico](http://www.cafeselmagnifico.com) (sadly doesn't work with Firefox), a nice coffee dealer near the cathedral to buy me some good coffee. Cristina wanted also some tea, and in front of C.E.M there is Sans & Sans Fine Tea, so it is the perfect place for us. I bought 250g of coffee from Java, an island in Indonesia. They told me it is good with milk and also alone, and indeed it is.

I have used it to make me some turkish coffee. The procedure is easy, and the result can be really good.  
  

1.  Grind the coffee several times, as it must be the finer the better.
2.  Put 2 and a half cups of cold mineral water in a narrow and tall heater (the taller and narrower the better, the best would be a cevze)
3.  Add 2 and a half teaspoons of sugar and stir it well.  
    
4.  Add the coffee to the water, spreading it evenly over the surface of the water.
5.  Heat slowly.
6.  When it starts to foam, stop the stove and stir carefully to keep some foam.
7.  Heat again until foaming starts, stop the stove and stir again.
8.  Repeat one last time.
9.  Wait 30 seconds for the coffee to settle.
10.  Take some foam with a spoon and put it on each cup, add then some coffee to them keeping in mind that you can't put all (as there is a lot of mold at the bottom).

The (blurred) result:
