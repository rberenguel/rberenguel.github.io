This is where Linux started. Minix, from the [bible on operating systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_Systems:_Design_and_Implementation). You can easily install it on [minivMac for your iPod](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2009/11/retro-on-ipod-touch-1-mini-vmac.html), download it from [this link](http://www.minix3.org/previous-versions/Macintosh/) and install the disk image in your iPod as usual. Then, unpack the files inside.

When unpacking is finished, just open the MacMinix app, and Minix will be up and running.
