Back when I was in school, I had a really nice game in my 80286 computer, under Windows 3.1. Yes, it was 15 years ago... The game was Hyperoid, by Edward Hutchins. When I got my first Pentium with Windows 95, I longed that game... and the 3.1. version didn't work completely OK in it. Anyway I played... then found [Hyperoid95](http://hem.passagen.se/rasmuse/Hyper95.htm). I even recompiled it, to add firepower (the author of this version cut the fire speed). It turns out that a X version exists, [xhyperoid](http://www.svgalib.org/rus/xhyperoid/)... and a newer version, [SDLRoids](http://www.eongames.com/games/sdlroids/) is what I was looking for. Improved add-ons, more options, MacOs binaries. Sweet old times!
