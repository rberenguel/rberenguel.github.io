My chair, my fractals (A4) and my [Drazen

[Rasterbator](http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/) is an online poster maker, for you to print in your own printer. Of course, the results are not as good as full quality posters like [these](http://www.cafepress.com/SiegelDisks), but they look pretty good when looked from afar. It rasterises an image you upload (or link from anywhere in Internet), does some magic stuff, and the result is a bunch (you decide graphically how many, orientation and other options) of A4 (or Legal) sheets arranged in a nice PDF, which you have to print. Then a little (transparent) duct tape and you can have really cool B&W or color posters (if your printer allows you to) in your office, home or wherever.  
  
Here you have a [user gallery](http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/gallery.gas?cool), with pictures. And you can see mine in this post, too. Enjoy your home-made posters, or check full quality posters from [here](http://www.cafepress.com/SiegelDisks), I produced the design!

Close and closer. Do you see the big dots (7 mm) now?
