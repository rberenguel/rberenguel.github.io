This weekend I bought three books:  
[Bill Evans: How My Heart Sings](http://www.amazon.com/Bill-Evans-How-Heart-Sings/dp/0300081138) (Bill Evans: Vida y Obra), [Martian Chronicles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_Chronicles), by Ray Bradbury (CrÃ³nicas Marcianas) and [The Lebanese Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Lebanese-Cookbook-Hussein-Dekmak/dp/0781812089/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204485145&sr=1-12) (a spanish edition). I have already finished Bradbury's, I enjoyed it a lot. A masterpiece in science-fiction. In one of its short stories there is a poem by Lord Byron:  

> So we'll go no more a roving  
> so late into the night  
> Though the heart be still as loving  
> And the moon be still as bright.
> 
> For the sword outwears the sheath,  
> And the soul wears out the breast,  
> And the heart must pause to breathe,  
> And Love itself have rest.
> 
> Though the night was made for loving,  
> And the day returns too soon,  
> Yet we'll go no more a roving  
> By the light of the moon.

A beautiful one, by the way.
