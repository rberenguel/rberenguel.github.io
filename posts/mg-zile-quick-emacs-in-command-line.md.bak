From [The Design of the Emacs Logo](http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/%7Eelf/emacs/logo/)  

  

I guess you may already know I love the emacs text editor, and use it as often as I can to do almost everything I can with it. I even [use it in my iPod touch](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2010/01/syncing-ipods-vmac-and-linux-emacs-on.html), through [minivMac](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2009/11/retro-on-ipod-touch-1-mini-vmac.html). But there is a small niche where it was a pain: quick editing a file from the command line. Those times when you just want to open one file, change a line, save and close.  
  
I have lots and lots of extensions for C programming and LaTeX editing... to change a line I don't need all the fuss, and it is a 2 second edit, for a 10 second emacs load. It doesn't pay off. For a while I was using [the editor from hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war#Humor), but I know just a few keystrokes, and don't want to learn any more, I am proficient enough with emacs and need no more commands. So I set myself to find other editors.  
  
Also, editing from my iPod touch with TouchTerm Pro is not easy... I have already an emacs-like side-keyboard I can use... with emacs keybindings, of course. I'll post it here someday to those everywhere system admins/code runners.  
  
First and simplest choice: [nano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano_%28text_editor%29). It has Control&Meta commands and syntax highlighting... and these are the only good point I found, besides being a Unix standard. Dismissed quickly, but more useful than [that](http://www.dina.dk/%7Eabraham/religion/vi-music) to a quick edit. Maybe I'll try to install it from source in my Linux box (I am not root... installing is a PITA).  
  
Then, [mg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mg_%28editor%29) (formerly known as microGNUemacs). Small, quick and as emacs-like as you can get without LISP as an extension language....  
  
Dismissed, as [Zile](http://www.gnu.org/software/zile/) (Zile Is Lossy Emacs) is part of the GNU project, more availability. It can be easily installed from source as a local user in Linux, and through [MacPorts](http://zile.darwinports.com/) in a Mac. No syntax highlighting, though. I would love to have it... :\_(
