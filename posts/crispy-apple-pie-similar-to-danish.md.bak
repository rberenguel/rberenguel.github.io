A few days ago I found [this recipe](http://dlynz.com/?p=452) via StumbleUpon. I had two apples I would not eat, and decided to give it a go. But I didn't have oatmeal, so I improvised. This is my version, which I call Crispy Apple Pie.  

  

If you have ever been to Denmark, they eat something named [Æblekage](http://www.google.es/images?q=%C3%86blekage&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi). I ate it last November, and I loved it. This is very, very similar... with a little whipped cream it would be almost the same.  

  

It is not a good-looking dessert, but it is the kind of dessert you can bake in a big plate for quite a few people... and when the party is over, there will be no Crispy Pie left. Guaranteed. Moreover, it does not take very long to do it (around 30 minutes only, plus 40 of baking time).  

  
What you will (roughly) need:  

*   Two apples
*   200 gr creamy cheese (Philadelphia or similar)
*   2 eggs
*   Crispy cookies (Graham crackers, galletas María...)  
    
*   Walnuts or some other nut (optional, more if you are allergic)  
    
*   Brown sugar (around 1'5 cups, but not all in one batch)
*   Cinnamon, powdered ginger, vanillated sugar or vanilla extract
*   Melted butter (around 7 tablespoons)  
    

I know the measurements are wishy-washy. This kind of dessert allows for quite adding sugar, removing sugar, adding butter or removing it. So feel free to put whatever you want. This is just the blueprint, you are the architect.  
  
The procedure is easy. Peel the apples and cut them like French fries Grease a pie plate liberally with butter, and place the apple sticks there. Add a quarter cup of brown sugar, a teaspoon cinnamon, a pinch of salt and a teaspoon ginger. Mix thoroughly (I used a fork for this).

Mix 200 gr of creamy cheese (Philadelphia, for instance) with two eggs, another quarter of cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon vanillated sugar or vanilla extract.

Once beaten, pour over the apples, extending evenly

Now crush some crispy type cookie (in Spain that would be Galletas María, in other parts of the world, Graham crackers... the kind of cookie you would use to make a cheesecake pie crust, crispy but not really sweet) to fill half a cup. Crush some walnuts (up to your taste), add 1/3 of cup of brown sugar, more cinnamon and 6 tablespoons melted butter. Mix thoroughly, all the cookie bits should be moist with butter.

Once you are done, spread it over the previous mix, as evenly as possible.

Bake for 40 minutes at 180ºC. It will be almost done when the sugar from the bottom starts to bubble at the top.

Let it cool down. When it is cold, the top will be crispy, the bottom soft and the taste amazing (if you like apple pies, of course).

Keep it in the freezer, it can last a few days... if you don't finish it before.

If you feel creative you can change the walnuts for pistachios or almonds, or the apples for peaches. The peach+almond combination is the next I'll try.
