Around 1/2lf of the moments in which I look at my headphones to put them in, I pick them "switched", i.e. I have (L)eft, I see an L and my head says (L)ight, then I see the other one, and it is (R)eft. Today I found out (R)eft is the past participle of reave, which means more or less "to rob". But usually, in the presence of (R)ight there is nothing (L)eft.
