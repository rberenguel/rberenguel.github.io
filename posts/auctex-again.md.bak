For a while I have been either not [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)ing a lot, or not using [AucTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auctex) frequently. Strange indeed! But in July, while in GÃ¶ttingen I wrote part of some lecture notes of one of the courses. And again, used auctex-preview in emacs to find errors in what I was writing.  

  

I can't even tell how wonderful it is, to share the source with the images with the formulas. An image is worth more than a [googol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol) words.
