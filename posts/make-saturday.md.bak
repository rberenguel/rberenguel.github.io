In Catalan, we have a curious expression, "fer dissabte", which could be translated as do the Saturday, or make Saturday as I have in the title. It describes what one should do every Saturday, as we did last Saturday: clean up the house. It took us 4 straight hours, from 11:30 to 15:30. Really tiring, but the results are great :)  
  
Clean more often!
