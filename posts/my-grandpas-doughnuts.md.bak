This is a recipe my grandfather used to make for me (and my cousins) when I was a child. Hopeyou like it as much as I liked it, and enjoy making fun figures and then eating them.

What you will need  

*   3 eggs,
*   3 tablespoons of olive oil,
*   3 tablespoons of sugar,
*   grated lemon skin (clean it before grating), or something to add flavour,  
    
*   1 tablespoon baking powder,
*   white flour,
*   sunflower oil or some similar light oil for deep frying.

Mix all the ingredients, and keep adding flour and mixing until the dough is firm and only just a little sticky. If you have ever made your own pasta, you should aim for the same kind of stickiness. Form doughnuts, or dough-men, or whatever. Heat about 1 inch of oil in a deep pan (enough oil to cover one doughnut) and fry them, one or two each time. Wait until soft brown, and turn them a few times to let them cook well.

Beware of burning them. Anyway, tastes great.  

  
Place them in a deep plate with some paper towels. After a few minutes they will look dry, not oily. While they are still oily, sprinkle some sugar over them (this way it keeps from falling). If you enjoyed this recipe, leave a comment to tell me how did it turn, give a thumbs up, digg or whatever you feel like doing, it will be a kind of homage to my grandpa. Share and enjoy!
