title: 'More emacs configuration tweaks (multiple-cursor on click, minimap, code folding, ensime eval overlays)'

At [Affectv](http://www.affectv.com/) we use a wide range of editors: Sublime, Atom, Emacs, Pycharm, IntelliJ... Actually only two people use the same editor! As such, from time to time I see things in other people's editors that I would like to have as well. So, yesterday I decided to improve on some configuration settings on Spacemacs.

Click for multiple-cursors
--------------------------

I saw this on Jordi's Sublime, and it is much more comfortable than using more-like-this or similar helper functions, even if I need to use the trackpad to do so. After all, a multi-cursor edit (proper edit, not as a substitute for a macro) is rare enough that I can tolerate leaving the home row. Easy enough to configure thanks to [Magnar Sveen](https://twitter.com/emacsrocks/status/304223468793237505).

  
```
(global-unset-key (kbd "M-<down-mouse-1>"))  
(global-set-key (kbd "M-<mouse-1>") 'mc/add-cursor-on-click)
```

Minimap
-------

Also from Sublime, I used to have this on my old emacs setup. As simple as adding minimap to the list of additional packages and configuring its property group. See animation below.

  
```
dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(helm-dash key-chord pig-mode mmm-mode minimap origami ansible)
```

Folding
-------

I have always loved how clean vim's folding works, and how Sublime has this nice folding. Then I found origami-mode and my emacs-life was complete. I tweaked a little the folding functions so that minimap was updated on fold (for some reason it is not, I guess minimap is tied to the "modified" hook or similar). I bound `z` and `Z` (and `A-z` which maps to `æ` in Colemak) to the basic fold operations.

  
```
(eval-after-load 'origami  
    '(progn  
       (defun rb-show-only (buffer point)  
         (interactive (list (current-buffer) (point)))  
         (progn (origami-show-only-node buffer point)  
                (minimap-new-minimap)))  
  
       (defun rb-toggle-rec (buffer point)  
         (interactive (list (current-buffer) (point)))  
         (progn (origami-recursively-toggle-node buffer point)  
                (minimap-new-minimap)))  
  
       (define-key evil-normal-state-map "æ" 'rb-show-only)  
       (define-key evil-normal-state-map "Z" 'origami-toggle-node)  
       (define-key evil-visual-state-map "Z" 'origami-toggle-node)  
       (define-key evil-insert-state-map "C-Z" 'origami-toggle-node)  
       (define-key evil-normal-state-map "z" 'rb-toggle-rec)  
       (define-key evil-visual-state-map "z" 'rb-toggle-rec)  
       (define-key evil-insert-state-map "C-z" 'rb-toggle-rec)  
   )))  
  

```  
For some reason just advising the functions with after didn't work, this is not great but does work. I left the Z bindings as they are, since I have not used them yet, and will probably delete them if I keep not using them.

**Note (2018)**: I moved to use yafolding (specifically yafolding-toggle-all and yafolding-toggle-element) at the end of 2017. Although origami is very good, yafolding works seamlessly under more languages. I bound Return in normal mode to toggle element and C-return to toggle all, as well as unbounding all the default bindings.

  

Execution overlays in Ensime (Scala)
------------------------------------

I saw this for [Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) in the emacs church meeting from August, and heard [@fommil](https://twitter.com/fommil) (I think it was him) mention that it was coming to ensime. And [indeed it was](https://twitter.com/fommil/status/766736564705759232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). And it's easy enough to use `C-c C-v C-r` (thing of it as extended **c**ommand, e**v**al, **r**egion to remember), given an open inferior Scala interpreter. Symbol prettify does not apply to overlays, so you need to customise the arrow used therein.
