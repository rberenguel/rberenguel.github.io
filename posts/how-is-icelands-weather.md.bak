The Sun street

As you may remember, Laia and me spent three weeks in Iceland for holidays two months ago. This is the third post in the series [Things you should read before travelling to Iceland](http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/08/things-you-should-read-before.html). If you came here directly don't forget to read the previous post in this series

Weather is not as bad as you may expect. As the saying goes, Iceland is green and Greenland is ice. Iceland's weather in summer is mildly warm, ranging from around 2ºC to 15ºC (or more). The cold weather comes from the wind, which blows almost constantly and can reach easily gusts of 120km/h _which in the Beaufort wind scale corresponds to hurricane strength_. And 2 degrees with strong wind can feel really cold.

  

Moreover, a lot of Iceland's sights are either near the coast or are waterfalls, thus the wind blowing gets you wet and helps in getting you colder still. As an ultimate addition, it rains quite often. Rain means just a little water from the side, not huge precipitation levels, but just a little every few hours. As locals say, if you don't like Iceland's weather, wait 5 minutes. You can go from sun to rain to wind to calm in 30 minutes. A funny quote from our travel guide says It's not like Iceland has bad weather, it is just that it has weather, and lots of it.

Be prepared for cold with wind. At least 3 cloth layers and a wind-shield jacket. I wasn't as prepared, and bought a wind-shield and a jacket from North 66 (Amazon affiliate link: [66 North](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%26fsc%3D2%26ih%3D4%5F3%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F0%5F1%5F0%5F0%5F1.48%5F117%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D66%2520north%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dapparel&tag=rbersblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&l=ur2&o=1)). They are pricey, but I found them up to it. Beware: my jacket is an European XL and my wind-shield an European M... keep an eye with the sizes.

The same picture... Different weather

  

But you should be also prepared for warm and sunny days, and don't be disappointed if you don't see them. But when they come, they are a big surprise: the sun really heats, even at 15ºC.
