Althouh I use AucTeX, which already has nice quick-writing techniques, I have found emacs' abbrev-mode together with skeletons are a nice addition to it, allowing me to be really quick at writing LaTeX. The included examples to use dabbrev and skeletons are for the mathbb and theorem environments.  
  
Sample usage: When I write \\mbb, and then open the left {, mbb gets expanded to mathbb... so I have \\mathbb{ as needed. The other example, I write \\bth, press space and get a nice \\begin{theorem} \\end{theorem} delimiters with the cursor positioned between them.  

  
This should be in ~/Abbrev.el  

> (define-abbrev-table 'text-mode-abbrev-table '(  
> ("mbb" "mathbb" nil 0)  
> ("bth" "" latex-skel-thm 0)  
> ...  
> ))  

The three dots are just to indicate my file is much, much longer. The following should be in a file ~/Skeletons.el  

> (define-skeleton latex-skel-thm  
> "Insert a \\\\begin{theorem} environment" nil  
> "begin{theorem}" \\n  
> \> \_ ?\\n  
> "\\\\end{theorem}")  

And finally, in your .emacs you should add the following lines:  
  

> (load "~/Skeletons.el")  
> (setq abbrev-file-name "~/Abbrev.el")  
> (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (abbrev-mode 1)))  

A suggestion from a friend, using the ç and Ç to add {} and \\\[\\\] with the cursor positioned in between. Done via keyboard macros:  

> (fset 'braces  
> (lambda (&optional arg) "Keyboard macro." (interactive "p") (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote (\[123 125 left\] 0 "%d")) arg)))  
>   
> (global-set-key (kbd "ç") 'braces)  
>   
> (fset 'displaymode  
> (lambda (&optional arg) "Keyboard macro." (interactive "p") (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote (\[13 92 91 13 13 92 93 up\] 0 "%d")) arg)))  
>   
> (global-set-key (kbd "Ç") 'displaymode)  

Although I may use the ç key (I'm a catalan speaker), in emacs I write generally LaTeX, in english... so I don't really have a use for it. I may change the "global-set-key" to set it just for LaTeX... or even create a minor mode for it (Non-Catalan-Keyb?).  

  
What speed-up keyboard tricks do you have in your .emacs file? Share them!
