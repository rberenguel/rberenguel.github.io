Have you ever wondered how to take a screenshot remotely, via the command line in a Linux system? Here is a way to do it. At the bottom you can also find a script to move it to the root of your personal page (if you have) to open the screenshot in your browser.  

  

I have a [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) program running inside [Slime (The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs)](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) in an [emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) instance running in my office computer. It has been running for quite a few hours (days), and top still marks it as 100%... The problem: if [emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs)/[Slime](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) cuts the [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) connection with the [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) client, it goes runaway. And I needed a way to "see" if [emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) was still connected. Without going there, obviously.  

  
Remote screen-shooting via the command line is the solution. The trick: use [xwd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xwd):  

> xwd -root -display :0.0 -out Screenshot.xwd

Then [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)'s mogrify to turn it into something easier to open:  

> mogrify -format jpg Screenshot.xwd

Caveats: In my case, the first two times I got a black screen. Why?  

> killall gnome-screensaver (or your particular instance of screen-saver)

And voilÃ :

emacs still connected  
  

The script to move it to your public\_html folder:  

> xwd -root -display :0.0 -out Screenshot.xwd  
> mogrify -format jpg Screenshot.xwd  
> chmod +x Screenshot.jpg  
> mv Screenshot.jpg public\_html/  
> rm Screenshot.xwd
