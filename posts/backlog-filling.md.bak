My backlog of things happening is quickly filling, faster than I can even keep track of it. Just a quick overview

#### Summer trip to Iceland

This summer we are going to Iceland for 17 days. It is some kind of tour-trip, where we have arranged accomodation and car rental and we just have to keep en route around the island to sleep where arranged each day. As an addition to this...

#### Learning Icelandic

You know, Laia and myself are quite odd... and we saw [Teach yourself Icelandic](http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Icelandic-Complete-Course/dp/0071420258?ie=UTF8&tag=rbersblog-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0071420258) at the same place we bought our travel guide and road map. The temptation was too big, and we bought. Now we are trying to learn Icelandic, not easy!

#### Bought a Ben NanoNote

A twitterer I follow posted [this review](http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Qi-Hardware-Ben-NanoNote/) of the Ben NanoNote... A really small, very limited, really nice, cheap, Linux palmtop computer. At the sported price tag I couldn't resist, and mine is coming next Tuesday. I'll keep you informed of what I use it for, still not clear what it can do beside being a cool gadget to have around home sitting idly.

#### Looking again at RedCode

As it happens to me once in a while, I'm again looking at playing [CoreWarrior](http://corewar.co.uk/)... But this time I committed myself better: I even wrote some programs I tested. I just have to find time to code the ideas that are sprouting at odd day moments, while I read the old numbers of the CW newsletter.

#### Blog redesign  

As I posted, my blog is undergoing a redesign (I'm rewriting all CSS in the blogger template I use, and when I'm done I'll just paste the blogger specific anchors).
