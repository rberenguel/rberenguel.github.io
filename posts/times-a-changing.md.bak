This blog was started on this day, and was written in Catalan until mid-2007. On
August 22nd, 2019 I moved from Blogger, my original blogging platform to GitHub
pages. Since the readership has shifted to English speakers and the interest of
the early posts is low (also, I had to port the posts to another format..) I
deleted a great deal (around 350, out of the 670 I had at migration time) of the
earliest posts. But, I wanted to keep the start date, for the memories.
