While I was in Iceland, I started to see visits coming to my blog from [www.hanselminutes.com](http://www.hanselminutes.com/)... A site I didn't know about. As soon as I got a decent wifi coverage I went to see what it was about... And it was a podcast!  

  
From his own description,

> Hanselminutes is a weekly audio talk show with noted web developer and technologist Scott Hanselman and hosted by Carl Franklin. Scott discusses utilities and tools, gives practical how-to advice, and discusses ASP.NET or Windows issues and workarounds.  

The interview where my blog was mentioned was [Hanselminutiae Eight: Interview with Dan Fernandez](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=239), and the post they talked about was [8 reasons for reinventing the wheel as a programmer](http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/03/8-reasons-for-re-inventing-wheel-as.html), after it appeared in HackerNews for a second time. I thought you could not re-post things to HackerNews, but it looks like I was wrong!
