Today I am leaving on holiday... Destination: [Iceland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland). It is funny, because we arranged everything (accomodation, car rental and such) just two weeks before [Eyjafjallajökull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull "2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull") started spitting ash. It have been a few months wondering whether we could make it to Iceland and come back... Fortunately the little volcano took a pause and here we go.  
  
I have a few scheduled posts for this few weeks (I'll be back around 16th July) but I will be again posting more frequently after I am back.  
  
If I can get Internet connection there (in Reykjavík it should be no problem, but I can't be so sure about the rest of the island) I'll try to post a comment or picture.  
  
Once we are back we will try to write a joint post: [Laia](http://www.shanidar.net/)'s pictures with maybe one or two mine (she is the photography enthusiast) and my text (with Laia's ideas and proofreading) explaining what we did, saw and experienced.  
  
See you soon!
