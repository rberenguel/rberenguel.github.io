I love the smell of old (really old, but not dusty) books. It reminds me of some kind of vanilla scent, that is only to be found in them. I smelled it a few weeks ago, when I bought [Conrad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_conrad)'s [Heart of Darkness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness), second hand 1972 Penguin Modern Classics edition (3€) in a second hand bookstore in [Göttingen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottingen) (Germany).
