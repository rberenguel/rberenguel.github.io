Last monday I bought an [Acer Aspire One, 8.9'](http://www.acer.es/acer/product.do?link=oln85e.redirect&changedAlts=&CRC=600100215#wrAjaxHistory=0), with an extra 6-cell battery and 15 minutes later I installed [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) ([Netbook Remix](http://www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/download-netbook) version) on it, and after realizing everything was working smoothly (except for the SD card reader... anyway, I have an external device for doing so) I installed the [Fluxbox window manager](http://www.fluxbox.org/).

Here you can see the [FluxBox](http://www.fluxbox.org/features/) [Root menu](http://www.fluxbox.org/features/), [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) in the "desktop"  
background and the [Toolbar](http://www.fluxbox.org/features/).[](http://www.fluxbox.org/features/)  

  
[Fluxbox](http://www.fluxbox.org/) is really lightweight, fast and responsive. Also, really configurable, via just text files, a thing I love. Also the netbook works really nice, the keyboard is not as tiny as I assumed (I have big hands), in fact I type there faster. The only drawback is the amount of time it takes to get a new computer to be OK! It took me 3 days to have a complete work environment (you know, LaTeX, emacs, InkScape...)
