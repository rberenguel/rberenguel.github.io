There are a few Mac applications I use so often, I couldn't live without them. And most of them are free, or really kind shareware.  

*   [Caffeine](http://www.lightheadsw.com/caffeine/): Keep your Mac from sleeping.
*   [Carbon Emacs](http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html) (F): Well, this is cross-platform. And you know, I can't live without it. Plus, Carbon Emacs has some nifty additions. Check it out!
*   [Disk Inventory X (F)](http://www.derlien.com/): Shows graphically the size of files sitting in your drives. A quick way to find those hard disk eaters you have but are not sure exactly where.  
    
*   [Growl](http://growl.info/): Let your applications talk to you.  
    
*   [Fugu](http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/): thin MacOS FTP client.
*   [Nethack](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2009/05/nethack.html): For the work breaks!  
    
*   [Platypus](http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus): Turn your bash script into a nice application.
*   [Reduce](http://reduce-algebra.com/): Algebraic manipulator, among others. Cross-platform.
*   [TabletDraw](http://www.moosoftware.com/tabletdraw.html) (S): 35$, but it is the best tablet drawing program I have come across, at least for this price. The shareware version has all options, but limited undo capabilities and just 2 layers.
*   [Think](http://freeverse.com/apps/app/?id=7013): Keep your attention in just one application.
*   [sLife](http://www.slifelabs.com/) (F): Easy time tracking for the Mac. But it seems to make Nethack crash :/  
    
*   [Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/) (F): The application launcher to beat all other application launchers. Pressing CMD-Space followed by i and enter to launch iTunes saves a lot of trackpad moving.
