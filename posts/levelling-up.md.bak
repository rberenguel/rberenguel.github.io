Sometimes I feel like a character from a [RPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) (or [NetHack](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2009/05/nethack.html)), where you have a certain level and experience, and as you advance killing monsters, your experience points go up, your level eventually rises and your enemies turn harder.

I guess life (or at least a mathematician's life while doing his thesis) is more or less like this... Enemies appear, you overcome them, and as you advance, they get stronger, bigger and thicker. From easy linear algebra to Cech cohomology, from convergence in euclidean spaces to convergence in \\ell^\\infty spaces over lattices...

Life is meant to be a test, throwing harder questions upon you?
