A few years ago I was looking for an origami CD case. I found [this site](http://www.papercdcase.com/about.php) (which uses [Tom Hull](http://mars.wnec.edu/%7Ethull/)'s design). Although it is a quick and neat design for an origami case, I don't like it, it feels like the CD is about to fall. So I tweaked for a while, and came up with this design. It takes a little longer to fold, but holds really firm, and looks nicer after.
