Interesting things to know before going to Iceland
--------------------------------------------------

As you may remember, [Laia](http://www.shanidar.net/) and myself went to Iceland for a 2 and half weeks trip last June-July. It was a wonderful experience, managed by the wonderful (and helpful!) people at [Nordic Visitor](http://www.nordicvisitor.com/). This is the first post in a series named Things you should read before travelling to Iceland. In these posts I will cover the following (I will add links to the individual posts here as I write them, [bookmark](http://www.delicious.com/) this page!):
