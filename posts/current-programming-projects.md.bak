This is just to remind me of what I'm doing and how is it going  

##### Approximation of images by randomly placed translucent triangles

> Finished the first version, it works (I used it for my [Christmas postcard](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2009/12/evolutionary-approximation-of-christmas.html)), but the speed is not really good. Should rewrite big parts to make it faster.

##### [Lisp raytracer](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2009/06/lisp-raytracing-again.html)

> Stalled as I was rewriting the refraction code of the rewritten inner loop. Will probably savage something, someday, but just don't know when.

##### [Forth raytracer](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2010/03/learning-forth-by-working-on-raytracer.html)

> Just an idea to work on to learn some Forth. Will start soon, using the framework and knowledge learnt while working in the Lisp version

##### Coupled map lattice simulations

> C code just for looking at how my theorem applies to some artificial models. I got some insights on further development while looking at 5x5 models. Re-used some code from my postcard gluing code to create the projected lattice images.

##### iPod Todo

> Javascript (JQuery+JQtouch) offline-able web app to beat all other to-do's. At least for me and some other users, as I will tailor it to suit our needs. Have some code, but will forget about it in some sense and do some design first, because the code is getting too convoluted.

##### [CJuicer](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2010/02/cjuicer-beats-humans-and-unixs-diff.html)

> Works pretty well. Should add some automated processing via some bash scripts to use it quicker, and solve a small problem with includes.

##### Cohen map

> gp-pari code to find transverse intersections for the Cohen map. I have the Taylor expansions code by hand, should write it and do a MAJOR rewrite of all code.

##### Approximating instability

> Need to improve the algorithms used before even thinking of publishing.

##### Lisp SIRDS

> Has some bug I still have not found. Not working on it since January.

##### Box iteration

> An idea I have. Should work it on pen and paper first.

  
  
I bet against myself 10â‚¬ that I have forgotten something in this list.
