A quick one: Graphical configuration for fluxbox: [fluxconf](http://freshmeat.net/projects/fluxconf/). You can just apt-get it. I found out about it in [tuxmachines.org](http://www.tuxmachines.org/), following this [link](http://linuxcritic.wordpress.com/2009/09/18/fluxconf-configuring-fluxbox-the-graphical-way/). But after using it I realized I had lost 3 entries... I am not sure if it was a bug, or what (they all had parentheses in them!). Use it at your own risk!
