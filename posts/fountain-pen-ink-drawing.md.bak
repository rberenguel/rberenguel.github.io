I got [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Pen-Ink-Techniques-Frank-Lohan/dp/0486474569?ie=UTF8&tag=rbersblog-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0486474569) for Christmas (more or less), and started to read and draw from it a few days ago. It is amazing what small hints can do to a messy drawing. The barrel, in particular, started as a messy outline (from the barrel in the book) and the final result looks pretty convincing (for me, at least).
