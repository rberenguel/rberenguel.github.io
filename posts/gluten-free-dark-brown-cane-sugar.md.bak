Although this looks like a all-free / no taste cake, it is wonderful. And of course, at it is gluten, dairy and egg free, almost everyone can eat it. What you will need:  

*   1 measure soy yogurt
*   1 measure dark brown sugar (we used Tate&Lyle Dark Brown Sugar)
*   1 measure gluten-free flour
*   1/4 measure oil
*   1 teaspoon baking powder

Here measure depends on how much iogurt do you have. You can use the iogurt cuprs to make all measurements. Mix well all ingredients, pour into a baking pan and put in the oven, 200ÂºC for 1 hour. Check very often... it is hard to tell when it is finished. It should be hard on the outside and soft on the inside, without leaving any trace on a toothpick. Enjoy!
