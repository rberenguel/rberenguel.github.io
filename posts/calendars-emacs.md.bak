My month, starting  
  

For the last two years, I have been really happy, living without a definite calendar. I just knew I had a meeting with my boss "next Monday", or had a workshop somewhere "in the last weeks of January". But these days I've come to realize I just need a calendar now... And finally managed to mix [org-mode'](http://orgmode.org/)s events with standard [emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) [calendar+diary](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html) views. This calendar is emacs calendar's mode standard one (I love its looks) but harvests information from org-mode's headlines and timestamps. I can now have the best of both worlds: a nice printed calendar (calendar mode), and a nice computerized one (org-mode).  
  
I had some problems with the setup of my diary file to open .org files, and the problem solved by putting this in my diary file:  

> &%%(org-diary :timestamp)

You can also restrict to just a particular file:  

> &%%(org-diary :timestamp) ~/path/to/file

And the useful options are :timestamp, :sexp, :schedule and :deadline, to select which things to show. The initial problem is the :sexp as default, it won't work with non-diary (org-mode's) diary entries.
