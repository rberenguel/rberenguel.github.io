_Emacs fun_, in other words. This weekend I'm writing some programs in C, to review major problems before my students ask. Yesterday I finished the part due Wednesday (for them), and today I tackled the final part. But there is some bug somewhere... I always miss on such matrix-here-matrix-there-solve-that.  

  

  

Today, after battling for an hour, I realized I missed the "[intellisense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense)" part of [CEDET](http://cedet.sourceforge.net/), and started to install it here in MacOs, and "there" in my netbook. The number of things you can do with it are... well, mind-blowing. I just use it for a few things, and probably with time will start using it more often. Like it.

GNU Debugger mode  

  

After too many printf's out there to debug, I decided to give a try and opened a terminal, wrote [gdb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger)... it works. I thought I had already tried in MacOs and didn't work... Well, then, give it a try together with emacs' gdb-mode (in fact it is the _Grand Unifier Debug_ mode... I use gdb). After having a quick peek to the user manual (WTF!? 493 pages!?) and discovering how to set up a breakpoint... I've fallen in love. Just it... I can write variables, follow variables, stop and go... I can't ask for more. And the way to interact is via emacs... I just say process until "here" with my cursor in the source code, where "here" is located... and here it goes (C-x C-a C-u). Whoa. Love it.

ECB  

  

And to add a little graphical goodness... ECB, an addition to CEDET's greatness. It makes emacs look like a "usual" IDE.
