Today I found some nice "gadget" to add to my browser. TiddlyWiki.  
  

It is a single html document you download, and save. And it behaves (locally, in your computer!) just as a wiki. Creating links, adding things, whatever you like. Use it like a blog, wiki, recipe book, sketchpage, whatever you like. All gets saved in the same html file you downloaded (advise: change its name).
