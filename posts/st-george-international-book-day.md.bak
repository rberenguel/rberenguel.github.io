The 23rd of April is a very special day in Catalonia. The legend of Saint George, in the Catalan version happens in a small town called Montblanc, and when the knight kills the Dragon from its spilled blood grows a red rose he gave to the princess. Since medieval times, men give their a rose to his significant other, and in 1923 something was added to this story.  
  
A bookseller wanted to spice the celebration, and as Miguel de Cervantes and William Shakespeare died on this same day, he promoted the giving of books as a present. Since then, men give roses and women give books (although the mutual exchange of books is customary now).  
  
I gave my girlfriend an origami rose (the diagrams are from [here](http://danoftoasters.org/), based on a version of Kawasaki's Rose found in [Origami for the Connoisseur](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4817090022?ie=UTF8&tag=rbersblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=4817090022)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=4817090022), Amazon link) and she gave me an amigurumi dragon. We are strange.

I also bought a standard rose, and she bought me two books: [Spade & Archer: The Prequel to Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307264645?ie=UTF8&tag=rbersblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307264645)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0307264645) and [Primer of Visual Literacy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262540290?ie=UTF8&tag=rbersblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262540290)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262540290) (Amazon links). I bought her [The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805088415?ie=UTF8&tag=rbersblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0805088415)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0805088415) (Amazon link).

It is a really nice day if you love books and reading (stores and parades offer a 10% price off), but it can be crowded. I tried to make a few pictures to show how crowded it can be, but I guess you need to be here to know. Next year it will be on Saturday, consider coming to Barcelona!
