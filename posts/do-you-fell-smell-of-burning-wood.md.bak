Santa brought me the gift I wanted for Christmas: a [pyrograph](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dpyrograph%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=rbersblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rbersblog-20&l=ur2&o=1). In case you don't know, a pyrograph is a tool to draw over wood, by burning it.  
  
As you may already know, I love drawing (in particular, ink drawing). This is similar: you don't have a lot of control over tone and a mistake can ruin the drawing.  
  
This was the first time I used one, and to test how it worked I decided to draw a Celtic knot over a wooden box. In the central part I tried a little shading and leaving open areas to get other types of tones. I started with the upper left knotted area, then the center, right and ended with the circle and border. I still have to clean the pencil drawing from the pyrography box, add some detail in the front and add some varnish.  
  
Some tips when starting to use a pyrograph:  

*   Trace the contour first, then fill it. It is far easier, and the burn from the trace prevents the burn from the filling to spread to the rest.
*   Move quickly, move constantly. If you stop for too long (to get a darker color) you can end with smoked areas (like in the left upper edge). Better to make repeated passes.
*   When you start, a Celtic knot is a good option: it is easy (only filled areas) and looks good.
*   Adjust the power of your pyrograph. My pyrograph has a scale from 0 to 10. I used 5 in the first area (where I got the smokey part) and then switched to 3 for the rest, except the brownish strings in the center know which were done at 0.6

I'm considering buying some books on pyrography from [The Book Depository](http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/?a_aid=mostlymathsdotnet), but I'm still undecided. The two options are:  

*   [Step by Step Pyrography](http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9781861084910/Step-by-step-Pyrography/?a_aid=mostlymathsdotnet)
*   [Great Book of Woodburning: Pyrography techniques, patterns and projects for all skill levels](http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9781565232877/Great-Book-of-Woodburning/?a_aid=mostlymathsdotnet)  
    

Which one do you think looks better? And what do you think of my first (still unfinished) box?
