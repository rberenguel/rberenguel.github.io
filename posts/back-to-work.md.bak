September is to months as Monday is to weekdays  

  

September is again here, like a new year in more than a sense. I have no new "New Year's promises", since the beginning of the year. In fact, most of the things I wanted to do are already done, on the way to be done or I gave up. Well, let's summarize what I shall do these three months to end 2009  

*   Draw more often,
*   Get ready the details for another article for next year,
*   Travel around,  
    
*   PHD-a-lot (really a lot),
*   Finish some odd things lying around (raytracer? Lisp? Christmas postcard? Emacs "book"? Fractal zoomer?)
