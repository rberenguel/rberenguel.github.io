Does not like like that, but tastes great!  

*   2 ripe avocados
*   1/2 cup coconut milk
*   2 tablespoons vanilla (or vanillated sugar)
*   3/4 cup agave syrup (or sugar syrup)  
    
*   1/2 cup lime juice  
    
*   1/8 tablespoon salt
*   3/4 cup coconut butter (or coconut oil)  
    
*   pie crust (below a recipe for it)

Mix all the ingredients (except the pie crust) in a blender.  

*   180 gr plain cookies
*   200 gr butter

Melt the butter and crush finely the cookies. Mix and place in the bottom of a cake pan, also on the sides of it. Pour the blended mix and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours.
