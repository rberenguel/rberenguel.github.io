Today I read through [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/science/18beer.html?ex=13634928) from the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/), where they show a correlation between number of good-level research articles and consumption of beer in the Czech Republic. More beer, less articles. It is still unclear if just bad (czech) scientists drown their sorrows in beer (not all of them, of course), and there are also a lot of counterexamples. Just a bizarre article.  
  
This made me think of a former [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/science/27murd.html?ex=133385) I read there, talking about student-advisor (as a side note, adviser and advisor are both accepted in English, amazing) problems. It is an interesting read, and when the time comes, you can just e-mail it to your advisor. Just to tell him "Hey, I'm still sane, but give me a break". In it a few real stories are given, where advisors are killed or threatened by their students.
