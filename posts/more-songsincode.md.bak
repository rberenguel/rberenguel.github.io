Last Friday, 20, all SongsInCode'rs were asked to try to get [#songsincode](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23songsincode) trending again to commemorate the 3 months anniversary of the idea. I submitted 3 songs (far less than my f[irst outburst](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2009/10/songs-in-code.html))... and almost no-one else tried to overwhelm twitter with his songs (a few did, and with great ideas ;)  

> KISS - know="you cry";know++="Walk street beside her"; PassBy(); everybody: puts("Looks good"); you: puts("Strutter"); goto everybody;  
>   
> Duran Duran - if(!cry(&Yesterday)){find(OrdinaryWorld);}  
>   
> 3 Doors Down - See(Face);days=0;do{days++;}while(days<100)older(me);dream: Dream(); you=1; here: you=0; goto dream;

[Here](http://berenguel.blogspot.com/2009/10/songs-in-code.html) you can find my previous post with my own songsincode, and also check the great ideas in [#songsincode](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23songsincode).
