*   2 or 3 fillets of marinated herring with onion (typical scandinavian)
*   3 marinated cucumber, polish (sweet) style
*   1 Golden (yellow and somewhat sweet, not acid) apple
*   3 boiled potatos, diced
*   1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
*   Optional: a little mustard

Slice finely the cucumber, cut the apple in dices and the fillets in small pieces. Mix the mustard, mayonnaise, a little vinegar from the herring and then add the fish, mix well. Add the potatoes and apple dices, and revolve a few times.  
  
If in Spain, you can find the marinated herring and cucumber in El Corte Ing√©s.
