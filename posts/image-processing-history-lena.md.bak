I am working in my free time in an image processing related program, and this made me remember when I was taking a course in _Signal Processing_. One of the standard test images was the one above. Where does this historical image processing snippet come from?  

  

[Turns out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna) (wikipedia link) it is a standard folklore image, dating back to the seventies, when a bunch of electrical engineers needed an image satisfying certain _signal problems_ (it is, indeed, an image with a lot of significative details, when compressing, denoising or whatever: the hat, the uniform colour distribution except for a few patches of different color...). They found that month's _Playboy_ magazine there in the shelves, and scanned the picture. And it remains as one of the usual test images, nowadays. A classical image.  

  

If you are interested, the project I was working on was [Approximating images with randomly placed translucent triangles](http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/04/approximating-images-with-randomly.html). I ended up using this program to get my Christmas postcard for 2009: [Evolutionary approximation of a Christmas postcard](http://www.mostlymaths.net/2009/12/evolutionary-approximation-of-christmas.html).
