Started a long time ago. It was supposed to be about a phenomenon leading to
chaos: [separatrix
splitting](/docs/20070906Splitting.pdf). I got a
research grant. I [worked on holomorphic
dynamics](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10236190903251738).
Travelled. [Presented](Presented.png). Too many
roadblocks with the separatrix problem. Switched topics. Welcome to a different
new world, [infinite dimensional dynamical
systems](/docs/20151104Lattices.pdf). I read the
literature. Researched, proved some things. My grant ran out. I worked. [A
lot](https://es.linkedin.com/in/rberenguel). Too many times I considered giving
up. Kept thinking of the [sunk cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs). My advisor and my girlfriend
helped me keep at it. I pushed on.

All this happened in early February, and since then many more things have
happened. Right now I'm working part in London and part at home as a mix of
software and data engineer, with a dash of devops to make it more spicy. Truly a
jack of all trades (but I specially like the data part).
