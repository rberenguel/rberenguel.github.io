<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for the perfect, really portable Bluetooth keyboard for several years. Typing on the go, or having a truly mobile office in your pockets is a really interesting concept for a consultant like me. You never know when opportunity or need may arise.</p>

<p>A year and a half ago I ordered what it looked like the perfect keyboard for that setup, but (even though it was supposed to arrive 3-4 months later) I&rsquo;m still waiting. Instead, I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Compact-MoKo-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Universal/dp/B01EHSLFAY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkId=161fa4fb9389541eb7c72c49f77bb8a6">this stupidly cheap</a> (around 25 $/€/£, this is an affiliate link) keyboard. See it below, with a pound and an iPhone SE for scale</p>

<h4 id="the-pros">The pros:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Folds in half. When folded, fits, barely, a large trouser pocket if you are slim. If you are wearing a jacket you can put it in a jacket pocket.</li>
<li>Weights very little</li>
<li>Great tactile feed. Has some scissor switches that feel sharper than the (from my feeling) decently good switches in 2013&rsquo;s Macbook Airs. Quite pleased with it (not as good feedback as my mechanical one with brown cherries, but this weights 20 times less or so)</li>
<li>Seems to have a decently long battery life</li>
<li>Disconnects on fold, starts up on unfold. A magnetic latch keeps it closed neatly</li>
<li>Has arrow keys and F keys</li>
<li>Good range</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-cons">The cons:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Can only be paired with one device at a time. So far this means that when I decide I want to pair it with my Mac instead of my iPhone, I need to forget the device and pair again. Not a big deal since I usually only want it for the phone or iPad, and repairing is fast</li>
<li>With a Colemak layout, the O is a small key, and a problem for me is that B is a left hand key and for me is a right hand key.</li>
<li>Alt acts like alt, no matter the operating system (you can change it with a key combination). On Mac you can tweak it, on iOS can&rsquo;t</li>
<li>Fn and Ctrl feel wrong as they are placed, should be swapped

<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Would I recommend it? Definitely. It has great feel and is a great price for quality keyboard. Oh, and this post was written all on it so I get used to the misplaced B. You can get one for Christmas from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Compact-MoKo-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Universal/dp/B01EHSLFAY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;linkId=161fa4fb9389541eb7c72c49f77bb8a6">here</a> (I&rsquo;d get a few cents if you do so, thanks in advance!)</p>

<p>And if you want to learn Colemak I learnt using <a href="http://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a>, and have had a lot of fun playing this online typing game, <a href="http://zty.pe/">Z-Type</a>. Both links are non affiliated and I have no relationship with them aside the learning or fun.</p>
