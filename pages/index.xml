      <description>Welcome! I&amp;rsquo;m Ruben Berenguel, the mind behind the writing here at mostlymaths.net. I have a PhD in Mathematics and work as a Site Reliability Engineer (Software Engineer) in Google Zurich. All the writing here represents (and has always represented unless explicitly stated in the post) my own views.
I have a varied set of interests, that range from reliability and data engineering, management (my previous job) to bespoke shoemaking (a previous job).</description>
