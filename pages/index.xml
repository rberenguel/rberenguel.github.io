      <description>Welcome! I&amp;rsquo;m Ruben Berenguel, the mind behind the writing here at mostlymaths.net. I have a PhD in Mathematics and work as a Lead Data Engineer.
I have a varied set of interests, that range from programming (my current work) to bespoke shoemaking (a previous work). You can imagine how much fits in-between.
You can reach me via:
 Twitter LinkedIn By email to ruben at this domain  You can find code I have written or contributed to, and slides for talks I have given on github.</description>
