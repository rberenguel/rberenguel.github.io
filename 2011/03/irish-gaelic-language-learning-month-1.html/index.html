foreign language?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been more than a month since I started my <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/02/february-march-and-april-challenge.html">goal of learning Gaelic</a>. I&rsquo;m not happy with how it is going, and I&rsquo;m the only one to blame for it. Why?</p>

<p>First, I have too many commitments. A few are with myself, others are with my girlfriend and then I have my thesis and research work. All together are way too much to handle in an usual work day, even in an &lsquo;extended work day&rsquo;, i.e. from 9 to 24 or 1.</p>

<p>I feel capable of learning up to a decent level a language in 3 months, given between thirty minutes and one hour of mindful dedication, daily. Maybe 15 minutes would be enough, if one day I did one full hour. The problem is that I don&rsquo;t have 15 spare minutes with full mental power. I usually end my research work pretty tired, and once I finish my usual stuff at home, the only thing left is watching Doctor Who on TV and going to bed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on a few ideas to solve the lack of time and be able to practice daily: invest 30 minutes twice a week and then you can practice wherever you are (the daily shower is a good moment to vocabulary recall, for example), because you will remember the lesson perfectly. I&rsquo;ll blog about this shortly, once I get the hang of it.</p>

<p>Just to lower my own expectations, it is very unlikely that I&rsquo;ll be talking Gaelic (Irish or Scottish, does not matter) by the end of April. But I still can have a shot at it. In any case, I&rsquo;ll improve my speed in language learning, at least from beginner to decent level.</p>

<p>As a side note, I ordered 6 new language books from <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/?a_aid=mostlymathsdotnet">The Book Depository</a>, all from the collection <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/search/advanced?searchTerm=&amp;searchSeries=135961/?a_aid=mostlymathsdotnet">Teach Yourself</a>:</p>
