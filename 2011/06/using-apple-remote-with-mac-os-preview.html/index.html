<p>Last Tuesday I presented a talk in a congress, here in Barcelona. This post is not about this talk, but about the Mac remote and Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;problems&rdquo;. If you are interested, you can download the talk <a href="http://www.maia.ub.es/%7Eruben/docs/20110531Centres.pdf">here</a>, anyway.</p>

<p>As the congress was local, instead of using my netbook for the talk I brought my MacBook. Instead of using arrow keys, I could use these fancy Apple remotes. Good plan&hellip; at the moment. I asked a colleague for his Apple remote (my girlfriend had hers in her office, and I could not get it soon enough)&hellip; And after lunch, before my talk I checked if it worked.</p>

<p>Well, as you already know, I use <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> and <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2009/11/scribus-for-mathematical-posters.html">Beamer</a> to create my presentations&hellip; And generate as output a PDF file. Which I then open with Preview, a native Mac OS app. And when I tried to use Apple Remote, it didn&rsquo;t pass the pages. Why? Well, Apple only supports a handful of applications, the most relevant being Keynote and Front Row. And not Preview. I was shocked.</p>

<p>As I expected, there was a free solution to this problem, but at first it looked troublesome. I found a program named <a href="http://www.filewell.com/iRedLite/">iRedLite</a>. <em>The &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; part scared me: would I be only able to pass 30 pages and then need to enter my registration?</em></p>

<p>Turns out it is &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; because there is a Pro version which can interact with a USB infra-red emitter to control your TV and other gadgets. It works wonderful, no problems. If you ever need to give a PDF presentation with a Mac, give it a try.</p>

<p>I had another solution which hopefully I didn&rsquo;t have to use: a free application for iPhone, RemotePad and RemotePad server in my Mac (there is also a Linux version). But passing pages is a little cumbersome, needing to flip+scroll in a very small screen. Far better to use the remote with iRedLite!</p>
