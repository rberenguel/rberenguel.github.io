<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/SM7F6dVju5I/AAAAAAAAAiE/VhRwFziR3ko/s1600-h/IMG_0005.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/SM7F6dVju5I/AAAAAAAAAiE/VhRwFziR3ko/s400/IMG_0005.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>What you will need</p>

<ul>
<li>3 eggs,</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of olive oil,</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of sugar,</li>

<li><p>grated lemon skin (clean it before grating), or something to add flavour,</p></li>

<li><p>1 tablespoon baking powder,</p></li>

<li><p>white flour,</p></li>

<li><p>sunflower oil or some similar light oil for deep frying.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all the ingredients, and keep adding flour and mixing until the dough is firm and only just a little sticky. If you have ever made your own pasta, you should aim for the same kind of stickiness. Form doughnuts, or dough-men, or whatever. Heat about 1 inch of oil in a deep pan (enough oil to cover one doughnut) and fry them, one or two each time. Wait until soft brown, and turn them a few times to let them cook well.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/SM7F6vi3lJI/AAAAAAAAAiM/lbylCiDpvMw/s1600-h/IMG_0004.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f3d3llNlZKQ/SM7F6vi3lJI/AAAAAAAAAiM/lbylCiDpvMw/s400/IMG_0004.JPG" alt="" /></a><br />
Beware of burning them. Anyway, tastes great.</p>

<p>Place them in a deep plate with some paper towels. After a few minutes they will look dry, not oily. While they are still oily, sprinkle some sugar over them (this way it keeps from falling). If you enjoyed this recipe, leave a comment to tell me how did it turn, give a thumbs up, digg or whatever you feel like doing, it will be a kind of homage to my grandpa. Share and enjoy!</p>
