Well, I looked into the lyrics of &ldquo;For Crying Out Loud&rdquo;, by Meat Loaf (who I hadn&rsquo;t heard about, ever). This are the lyrics, and as almost all Steinman&rsquo;s-Meat Loaf songs, they are quite long. Just read the first few verses if you don&rsquo;t feel like reading:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was lost till you were found<br />
But I never knew how far down<br />
I was falling<br />
Before I reached the bottom<br />
I was cold and you were fire<br />
And I never knew how the pyre<br />
Could be burning<br />
On the edge of the ice field</p>

<p>And the now chilly california wind<br />
Is blowing down our bodies again<br />
And were sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand<br />
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart<br />
And cant you see my faded Levis bursting apart<br />
And dont you hear me crying:<br />
Oh babe, dont go<br />
And dont you hear me screaming:<br />
How was I to know?</p>

<p>Im in the middle of nowhere<br />
Near the end of the line<br />
But there&rsquo;s a border to somewhere waiting<br />
And theres a tankful of time<br />
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day<br />
And take me to another land where I dont have to stay</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do<br />
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,<br />
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through</p>

<p>For crying out loud<br />
You know I love you<br />
For crying out loud<br />
You know I love you<br />
For crying out loud<br />
You know I love you</p>

<p>I was damned and you were saved<br />
And I never knew how enslaved<br />
I was kneeling<br />
In the chains of my master</p>

<p>I could laugh but you could cry<br />
And I never knew just how high<br />
I was flying<br />
Ah, with you right above me</p>

<p>Im in the middle of nowhere<br />
Near the end of the line<br />
But theres a border to somewhere waiting<br />
And theres a tankful of time<br />
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day<br />
And take me to another land where I dont have to stay</p>

<p>And Im gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do<br />
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,<br />
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through</p>

<p>For crying out loud<br />
You know I love you<br />
For crying out loud<br />
You know I love your<br />
For crying out loud<br />
You know I love you</p>

<p>For taking in the rain when Im feeling so dry<br />
For giving me the answers when Im asking you why<br />
And my oh my<br />
For that I thank you</p>

<p>For taking in the sun when Im feeling so cold<br />
For giving me a child when my body is old<br />
And dont you know<br />
For that I need you</p>

<p>For coming to my room when you know Im alone<br />
For finding me a highway and driving me home<br />
And you gotta know<br />
For that I serve you</p>

<p>For pulling me away when Im starting to fall<br />
For revving me up when Im starting to stall<br />
And all in all<br />
For that I want you</p>

<p>For taking and for giving and for playing the game<br />
For praying for my future in the days that remain<br />
Oh lord<br />
For that I hold you</p>

<p>Ah but most of all<br />
For cryin out loud<br />
For that I love you</p>

<p>Ah but most of all<br />
For cryin out loud<br />
For that I love you</p>

<p>Ah but most of all<br />
For cryin out loud<br />
For that I love you</p>

<p>When youre crying out loud<br />
You know I love you</p>

<p>It starts as a quiet ballad with only vocal and piano, for the first &ldquo;section&rdquo;, then guitar and drums get in, and for the last few verses just vocals. The second section is by far the best of this song. Listen to it if you can (just look it up at Youtube).</p>

<p>I listened to it, liked it an thought &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s listen to the whole album&rdquo;. I listened to it, but mostly didn&rsquo;t like it. Too long songs, maybe? But after more and more re-listenings, I started enjoying it. It features 7 songs, totalling about 50 minutes. It features a mixture of some kind of epic rock (Steinman wrote a musical called Das Rheingold&hellip; based upon a Wagner&rsquo;s opera) with quite exhilarating lyrics, where teenage (and not so) emotional commitments are developed. As a few examples:</p>

<p>From the chorus in Two Out Of Three Ain&rsquo;t Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And all I can do is keep on telling you<br />
I want you<br />
I need you<br />
But there ain&rsquo;t no way<br />
I&rsquo;m ever gonna love you<br />
Now don&rsquo;t be sad<br />
&lsquo;Cause two out of three ain&rsquo;t bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sad, but relatively funny. This is from Paradise By The Dashboard Light, a duet. This song is about a teenage couple, in their car, night, alone&hellip; you know. This is from the first &ldquo;act&rdquo;, where they are parking, and starting things</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t no doubt about it we were doubly blessed<br />
&lsquo;Cause we were barely seventeen<br />
And we were barely dressed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The intermediate section is the broadcast of a baseball game, using the baseball metaphore (about sex). For the last section, the girl asks several times whether he will love her forever, and never leave her, while the boy answers &ldquo;let me sleep on it, I&rsquo;ll give you an answer in the morning&rdquo;. The singing goes quicker until a climax is reached,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t take it any longer<br />
Lord I was crazed<br />
And when the feeling came upon me<br />
Like a tidal wave<br />
I started swearing to my god<br />
And on my mother&rsquo;s grave<br />
That I would love you to the end of time<br />
I swore I would love you to the end of time</p>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m praying for the end of time<br />
To hurry up and arrive<br />
&lsquo;Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you<br />
I don&rsquo;t think that I can really survive<br />
I&rsquo;ll never break my promise or forget my vow<br />
But God only knows what I can do right now<br />
I&rsquo;m praying for the end of time<br />
So I can end my time with you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope you get it. Loaf and Steinman had a lot of trouble to get this album published, but in time it has proven as quite a best seller. Nowadays it sells 200.000 copies-a-year, and has sold more than 30 million copies.</p>

<p>A year or so ago, I was having my breakfast where I usually do, they have a large LCD screen with MTV turned on. I was chewing my croissant and reading &ldquo;La Vanguardia&rdquo;, when the voice I heard was somewhat familiar. I looked and saw a man which resembled Meat Loaf. This was Bat Out Of Hell III, and the song I was listening to was It&rsquo;s All Coming Back To Me Now. Written, of course by Jim Steinman, recorded a few years ago by Céline Dion. A genuine power ballad with, as usual, quite expressive lyrics. Don&rsquo;t miss it when you go to YouTube. By the way, Steinman also wrote a song I like, Total Eclipse Of The Heart (Bonnie Tyler, she had performed it with Loaf as a duet).</p>

<p>As a final note, these are the lyrics of &ldquo;You Took The Words Out Of My Mouth&rdquo;. Possibly one of the best verses for a chorus I&rsquo;ve ever heard:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Spoken:]<br />
[Boy:] On a hot summer night,<br />
would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?<br />
[Girl:] Will he offer me his mouth?<br />
[Boy:] Yes.<br />
[Girl:] Will he offer me his teeth?<br />
[Boy:] Yes.<br />
[Girl:] Will he offer me his jaws?<br />
[Boy:] Yes.<br />
[Girl:] Will he offer me his hunger?<br />
[Boy:] Yes.<br />
[Girl:] Again, will he offer me his hunger?<br />
[Boy:] Yes!<br />
[Girl:] And does he love me?<br />
[Boy:] Yes.<br />
[Girl:] Yes.<br />
[Boy:] On a hot summer night,<br />
would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?<br />
[Girl:] Yes.<br />
[Boy:] I bet you say that to all the boys!</p>

<p>[Sung:]<br />
It was a hot summer night<br />
and the beach was burning.<br />
There was fog crawling over the sand.<br />
When I listen to your heart<br />
I hear the whole world turning.<br />
I see the shooting stars falling<br />
through your trembling hands.</p>

<p>You were licking your lips<br />
and your lipstick shining.<br />
I was dying just to ask for a taste.<br />
We were lying together in a silver lining<br />
by the the light of the moon.<br />
You know there&rsquo;s not another moment<br />
Not another moment<br />
Not another moment to waste.</p>

<p>You hold me so close that my knees grow weak.<br />
But my soul is flying high above the ground.<br />
I&rsquo;m trying to speak but no matter what I do<br />
I just can&rsquo;t seem to make any sound.</p>

<p>And then you took the words right out of my mouth.<br />
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.<br />
You took the words right out of my mouth.<br />
And I swear it&rsquo;s true,<br />
I was just about to say I love you.<br />
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.<br />
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.<br />
You took the words right out of my mouth.<br />
And I swear it&rsquo;s true,<br />
I was just about to say I love you.</p>

<p>Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water<br />
And I guess that I&rsquo;m beginning to grin.<br />
Oh we&rsquo;re finally alone and we can do what we want to.<br />
The night is young<br />
And Ain&rsquo;t no-one gonna know where you<br />
No-one gonna know where you<br />
No-one&rsquo;s gonna know where you&rsquo;ve been.<br />
You were licking your lips<br />
and your lipstick shining.<br />
I was dying just to ask for a taste.<br />
We were lying together in a silver lining<br />
by the the light of the moon.<br />
You know there&rsquo;s not another moment<br />
Not another moment<br />
Not another moment to waste.</p>

<p>And then you took the words right out of my mouth.<br />
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.<br />
You took the words right out of my mouth.<br />
And I swear it&rsquo;s true,<br />
I was just about to say I love you.<br />
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.<br />
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.<br />
You took the words right out of my mouth.<br />
And I swear it&rsquo;s true,<br />
I was just about to say I love you.</p>
