More beer, less articles. It is still unclear if just bad (czech) scientists drown their sorrows in beer (not all of them, of course), and there are also a lot of counterexamples. Just a bizarre article.
This made me think of a former article I read there, talking about student-advisor (as a side note, adviser and advisor are both accepted in English, amazing) problems." />

<p>This made me think of a former <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/science/27murd.html?ex=133385">article</a> I read there, talking about student-advisor (as a side note, adviser and advisor are both accepted in English, amazing) problems. It is an interesting read, and when the time comes, you can just e-mail it to your advisor. Just to tell him &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m still sane, but give me a break&rdquo;. In it a few real stories are given, where advisors are killed or threatened by their students.</p>
