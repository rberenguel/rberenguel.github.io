<p><a href="http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/emacs/logo/">The Design of the Emacs Logo</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting a new Macbook lately (my heart and wallet were divided among a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJABQ?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393177&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWJABQ&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;keywords=macbook%20air%2011%26%2334%3B&amp;qid=1341686972&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-1">11&rdquo; Air</a> or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007471PZQ?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393177&amp;creativeASIN=B007471PZQ&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;keywords=macbook%20pro%20retina&amp;qid=1341685278&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">15&rdquo; Retina Pro</a>). My 4-year old Macbook (Early 2008 I think, 2 GB Ram, Intel Core Duo 2.4 GHz) was showing its age. Mainly when I had the RAM and cache hungry inhabitants of my dock active: Yorufukurou (the best twitter client for managing multiple accounts in a Mac I&rsquo;ve seen) and Sparrow (mail client).</p>

<p>Why was I using Sparrow? Back when I started my current job, I was using gnus in emacs, after the quite successful <a href="http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/12/emacs-30-day-challenge.html">30 days in emacs challenge</a> I did in the beginning of that year. But for some reason I can&rsquo;t remember I moved from gnus to Thunderbird, which I could use both in my Mac and my netbook (I have the vague feeling that gnus had some problems in my netbook). I kept using Thunderbird for a long while until I found Sparrow. What did I find so appealing about Sparrow? <em>Keyboard shortcuts</em>. Yeah, I want to archive, move and delete mails quickly without moving my mouse. Sparrow had that (Apple Mail and Thunderbird do not.) What baffles me is why I didn&rsquo;t try gnus again. Anyway.</p>

<p>I was so happy, pressing keys and moving emails around. But my Mac was increasingly sluggish: if I had Chrome with more than a handful of tabs, Sparrow and Yorufukurou I could get the spinning beachball of death after doing anything. So you can imagine what PITA was starting MAMP or running a Django test server (for my <a href="http://blog.whatlanguageis.com/">What Language Is project</a>, among others). The purge command only helped a little, closing Chrome, Adium and others did almost nothing. Rebooting helped some more, but wasn&rsquo;t a decent solution. What was the problem?</p>

<p>Paging. And caching. In the last months I&rsquo;ve been living with around 3-4 GB of free space. It should be plenty for system paging in the disk cache. The problem is that it was not plenty for Sparrow&rsquo;s mail cache. I found this out when, after a reboot my hard disk showed almost 3 more free GB. It could not be Chrome&rsquo;s cache, since I had cleared it very recently. It could not be my Mac&rsquo;s cache, since last time I checked before rebooting I had less than 1 GB paged and had some (little) free memory still. I opened Sparrow and then checked its caches in the Library folder. amounted to more than 1.5 GB, just after booting. Damn.</p>

<p>Just by coincidence around this time I read <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/07/transcript-emacs-chat-john-wiegley/">a post by Sacha Chua, talking with John Wiegley</a> (emacs lisp developer) and thought: maybe it&rsquo;s time to give gnus another try. I thought I&rsquo;d need some heavy configuration tweaking or whatever before getting to grips with it. I thought I had a reason for giving up gnus. Just in case aliases or multiple accounts were a problem before, I disabled gmail and only left my work account (I&rsquo;d use gmail in the web interface for personal emails) before starting gnus again. My password was wrong, I changed it. I set up multiple mail aliases for my work account: tweaked the borrowed function I was using to select an SMTP account to switch to my main account in case of unknown account (since I have more than 20 aliases over it and configuring all them was overkill.)</p>

<p>Used gnus again for a while. My Mac was floating around without paging. The fan didn&rsquo;t spin. No hard drive sounds. Quick keyboard shortcuts I almost know by heart by now. Gnus, here I am again.</p>
