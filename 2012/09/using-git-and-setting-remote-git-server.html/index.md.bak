It's been almost 6 years since I used some kind of version control system. Back
then I wasn't sure about which I wanted to useâ€¦ I settled with RCS, the father
of them all. RCS was structurally simple, with text-based (human-readable) delta
files. I liked that. I had all my code and TeX files under revision control, but
then I started using more than one computer and it got out of hand quickly
(using RCS or CVS in Windows was quite tricky and had user and encoding
problems.) <!--more-->Stopped using it. After a few years I tried
[darcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcs)â€¦ unconviced. Then I put some of my
code in the cloud, in Google Code, so I got to use a little SVN. Not for version
control, just for having my code online and tidy. Nothing else.

It was about time that I got again into source code control. For part of my work
I will use mercurial, so for my side projects I will be using `git`, to see what
else is trendy right now. Yeah, it has taken me ages to do it ðŸ˜„


I put my thesis under control and committed a few revised sections. So far it
works wonders with the built-in emacs `vc-mode` (version control mode.) I even
get a neat menu to check in/out or check the commit story. I have not checked
yet its interaction with `github` with push or pull, but I guess it will work as
well. If it doesn't, my emacs loving twitter
palsÂ [Rami](https://twitter.com/ramimassoud) and
[Anti](https://twitter.com/pxlpnk) have suggested the `magit` package. I'm not
sure about it, because it is recommended when `git` is your only version control
system, and I also want to use `mercurial`. Only time will tell, though.

  

By the way, the first real commit I did was for my work in progress with getting
some [acme magic into
emacs](http://www.mostlymaths.net/2012/09/editor-magic-emacs-vim-acme-and-return.html).
You can check it [here](https://github.com/rberenguel/scame/)Â in github (which
works well so farâ€¦ why did it take me so long?).

I got it configured in my server, Macbook and... iPod Touch. Now I have my emacs
org-based calendar wherever I go, with (manual) syncing among machines.
