      <description>&lt;p&gt;My reading list is at less than 10 items, so now my &lt;em&gt;readings&lt;/em&gt; posts will hopefully look closer to &lt;em&gt;watchings&lt;/em&gt;. My watch-later list is at more than 90.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A relatively common type of query for time-based SQL tables is a &lt;em&gt;find the gap&lt;/em&gt; query. How can you do this in AWS Redshift, which does not have the SQL function &lt;code&gt;generate_series&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://mostlymaths.net/2020/10/snowflake.html/&#34;&gt;reading the Snowflake paper&lt;/a&gt;, I got curious about how similar engines work. Also, as I mentioned in that article, I &lt;em&gt;like knowing how the data sausage is made&lt;/em&gt;. So, here I will summarise the &lt;a href=&#34;https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/p975-armbrust.pdf&#34;&gt;Delta Lake paper by Databricks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about Snowflake, so I decided to have a look at its SIGMOD (&lt;em&gt;ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yxy/cs839-s20/papers/snowflake.pdf&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; and investigate a bit more what special capabilities they offer, and how they compare to others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a hard push to clean up my reading list, deleting &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; and reading &lt;em&gt;another lot&lt;/em&gt;. It went from 369 items to 99 🎉&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have been paying attention, you may have seen me talk about p5js and generative art lately. Here is a break-down of the why and how.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Skipped last week &lt;code&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt; This week has more machine learning than usual for no special reason. Posting this at 4 AM because for some reason I could not sleep and decided I may as well finish this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A context manager to measure elapsed time?</title>
      <link>https://mostlymaths.net/2020/01/context-managing-time.html/</link>

      <guid>https://mostlymaths.net/2020/01/context-managing-time.html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around a year ago (give or take a few months), I was talking with a coworker about context managers, and a question arose: could you use a context manager to measure elapsed time? I stashed the question away, and created a project &lt;em&gt;Timing Context Manager&lt;/em&gt;, which I actively ignored for many months. New year, new me, and a conversation with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/marcraminv&#34;&gt;Marc Ramírez&lt;/a&gt; moved me to unblock some of my old projects. This was the easiest project I had in Python, so I moved it to active.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First edition of the New Year. As eclectic as usual, I hope. The audio-based monitoring of servers and the weird uses of the GPT-2 neural network could be two highlights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend likes to joke/complain that I have more keyboards than hands. And indeed, I have probably a dozen or so different keyboards, most of them bluetooth. But, I have found the best one for the day-to-day work (sadly it is not bluetooth). It is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gboards.ca/product/gergo&#34;&gt;Gergo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week is somewhat more eclectic than usual. There is nothing about any
particular programming language. There is a bit on Kubernetes, functional
programming and containers, project management, aviation history,
interviews/bios… I have started reading a few more papers, and I’ll share the
interesting ones as well. This week they are centered in data engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I skipped last week. On Saturday &lt;a href=&#34;http://pybcn.org&#34;&gt;Python Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;
organised &lt;a href=&#34;https://pybcn.org/pyday-bcn-2019/&#34;&gt;PyDay 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and I was one of the
organisers aside from giving &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/pyspark_workshop&#34;&gt;a workshop on
PySpark&lt;/a&gt;, so I felt pretty tired
on Sunday. Of course this means this is a double issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week there is a lot of functional programming (mostly Scala, a bit of
Haskell) and data engineering topics. Of course, there is also the usual random
stuff I find interesting as well (and other engineering topics).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This feels like a heavy engineering edition. A lot of Haskell, Rust, Python and
Scala. There’s still a bit of everything, but this will appeal hardcore
developers more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a slightly longer edition because my reading list was overflowing with
400+ articles. I “trimmed” it down to “only” 380 during this week, I had a lot
of airport time due to going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe&#34;&gt;Spark Summit
Europe&lt;/a&gt; to give a talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some data engineering, a bit of Haskell, programming music, Python and random
bits and bobs. I recommend you play with the third. Several good books this
week, as I have ramped up my reading: current goal would be 52 this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A (section) of a map of the data engineering space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The map and problem described here were part of my presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rberenguel/mapping&#34;&gt;Mapping as a tool for thought&lt;/a&gt;, and mentioned in my interview with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jhngrant&#34;&gt;John Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BenMosior&#34;&gt;Ben Mosior&lt;/a&gt; (to appear sometime soon in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9-K9BLFozmmvmWzjyjkow&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps community youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;). I’m looking for ideas on how to make this map easier to understand and useful, so I posted it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.wardleymaps.com/t/rfc-a-section-of-a-map-of-the-data-engineering-space/452&#34;&gt;Wardley Maps Community forums requesting comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you have have known me for any length of time you&amp;rsquo;ll know I write mostly Python and Scala lately (Rust is getting into the mix slowly). And you should know, I am a heavy emacs user. I have been using emacs for close to 15 years, for the past 3 my emacs of choice has been spacemacs. I used to have a very long, customised and complex .emacs and with spacemacs I get a mostly-batteries-included package.</description>

      <title>gtags (GNU global) in emacs for Scala</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I’m a heavy &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mostlymaths.net/search/label/emacs&#34;&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt; user, and a frequent Scala developer. Scala tooling for emacs was restricted to mostly ensime until recently. Although ensime is an excellent piece of software, it made my old Macbook suffer a lot (it only had 8gb of RAM). So, most of the time I just went hardcore mode developer, and worked with no autocompletion, no jump to definition, no-nothing. A pervasive use of ripgrep and good memory were sometimes enough, but I was envious of many things I could see in my colleagues using IntelliJ. Of course, switching editors was not an option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Testing and debugging Apache Airflow We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Airflow for almost a year (on my suggestion). I&amp;rsquo;m not super-happy with it, and testing it is one of the pain points.</description>

Because, even if I don’t write it, I read a lot anyway. Also, there’s lot of interesting content this “week”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I keep it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of my to do stored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://culturedcode.com/things/&#34;&gt;Things3&lt;/a&gt;. It used to be &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; (hovering around 230 items since August) but during Christmas it got out of control, reaching almost 300 items.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I have been working a lot with a relatively large dataset on a Spark shell. It was a graph with 1 billion nodes and 2 billion edges that I wanted to analyse with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/graphframes/graphframes&#34;&gt;GraphFrames&lt;/a&gt; (the successor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.1/graphx-programming-guide.html&#34;&gt;GraphX&lt;/a&gt; on Spark).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though I have been a long time user of &lt;a href=&#34;http://ohmyz.sh/&#34;&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/a&gt; on zsh (moved from &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2KqeJR4&#34;&gt;plain bash to zsh&lt;/a&gt; like 10 years ago), I have been minimal on my use of its theme capabilities. I have used the default theme forever: &lt;code&gt;robbyrussell&lt;/code&gt;. But recently I was showing my friend @&lt;a href=&#34;http://crafty-coder.com/&#34;&gt;craftycoder&lt;/a&gt; the tweaks I have on my system (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/junegunn/fzf&#34;&gt;fzf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wting/autojump&#34;&gt;autojump&lt;/a&gt;, etc) and he showed me this theme, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme&#34;&gt;agnoster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days go I played a bit with a naive implementation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter&#34;&gt;Bloom
filters&lt;/a&gt; in Python. I wanted to time
them against just checking whether a field is in a set/collection. I found
something slightly puzzling: it looked like the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; worked &lt;em&gt;too fast&lt;/em&gt; for
smaller lists. And I wondered: maybe small lists are special internally, and
allow for really fast lookups? Maybe they have some internal index? This raised
the question: how does &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; find stuff &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; sequences?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran into this problem with &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;/code&gt; dependency resolution around 7 weeks ago. I
was in a hurry, so I commented out the offending import (since it was not in the
subproject I was working on, so was not needed for the run I was in) sent my
commit to the heavens and &lt;a href=&#34;https://circleci.com/&#34;&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt; was happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Processing from Scala</title>

      <guid>https://mostlymaths.net/2018/03/processing-and-scala.html/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had always wanted to play with Processing (after leafing through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Processing-Programming-Handbook-Designers-Artists/dp/026202828X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1520004355&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=processing+handbook&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;amp;linkId=08457cedf1bdf882589a65f2a56c181b&#34;&gt;The
Processing
Handbook&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Data-Explaining-Processing-Environment/dp/0596514557/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;amp;linkId=3aa08467e0b53ce75e261bf7a9d7cf3c&#34;&gt;Visualizing
Data&lt;/a&gt;
some years ago). My general dislike for Java or the JVM made me just play a
short amount of time with &lt;code&gt;processing.js&lt;/code&gt; something around 2011 (there was a
&lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; processing.js application for iOS, I used it for a while on my iPad and
iPod Touch).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I stumbled into the problem of Akka logging, specifically
ClassNotFoundException when using &lt;code&gt;akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLoggingFilter&lt;/code&gt;, just by
following the details of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/logging.html&#34;&gt;Logging - SL4J section of Akka

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to make these posts a tradition (even if a few days late). I thought 2016 had been a really weird and fun year, but 2017 has beaten it easily. And I only hope 2018 will be even better in every way. For the record, when I say &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, it means Laia and me unless explicitly changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how useful this Docker &amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo; is, since it happens in a very niche situation.
At work, we have several instances running a suite of Docker containers, with some non-trivial amount of environment variables, port configurations, volumes and links among them. This is set up really easily using ansible: writing link/port/volume mappings in ansible (using the docker, container or docker-container modules, depending how long ago we set it up).</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I needed to parse configuration files in Scala for a Spark project and decided to use PureConfig. It is incredibly lean to use, needing minimal boilerplate. I recommend you check it out (give also a look at CaseClassy, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to test yet).
Everything seemed straightforward enough, and I got it working pretty quickly (as in, it compiled properly). The surprise? spark-submit failed with a conflict with Shapeless (lacking a witness).</description>

      <description>I have been looking for the perfect, really portable Bluetooth keyboard for several years. Typing on the go, or having a truly mobile office in your pockets is a really interesting concept for a consultant like me. You never know when opportunity or need may arise.
A year and a half ago I ordered what it looked like the perfect keyboard for that setup, but (even though it was supposed to arrive 3-4 months later) I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting.</description>

      <description>This has been the first time I could attend the Apache Kafka meetup in London. Previous meetings had me in Barcelona or flying. First realisation: it is a surprisingly crowded meetup! Clearly, everyone is using Kafka, even if it is not clear from the outside. Oh, and the food was pretty good, too. Thanks to the sponsor (which I have sadly forgotten).
I really enjoyed this one. The speaker was Jay Kreps, CEO and co-founder of Confluent (and author of I Heart Logs), so, basically, a Kafka top committer himself.</description>

      <description>At Affectv we use a wide range of editors: Sublime, Atom, Emacs, Pycharm, IntelliJ&amp;hellip; Actually only two people use the same editor! As such, from time to time I see things in other people&amp;rsquo;s editors that I would like to have as well. So, yesterday I decided to improve on some configuration settings on Spacemacs.
Click for multiple-cursors I saw this on Jordi&amp;rsquo;s Sublime, and it is much more comfortable than using more-like-this or similar helper functions, even if I need to use the trackpad to do so.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I attended (first time I managed in almost 6 months) the London chapter of the Emacs Church (also known as the local meetup for emacs lovers). In this event we were shown (John Stevenson was the presenter) how to use emacs effectively for Clojure development (using Cider) and I saw in real life Spacemacs.
In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, Spacemacs is a &amp;ldquo;distribution&amp;rdquo; of Emacs prepared (is open source, of course) to be easy to setup, and somehow specially prepared for former Vim users to move to Emacs.</description>

Presented. Too many roadblocks with the separatrix problem. Switched topics. Welcome to a different new world, infinite dimensional dynamical systems. I read the literature. Researched, proved some things. My grant ran out. I worked. A lot. Too many times I considered giving up.</description>

      <description>Back in the days of yore, when I was switching between my Windows machine and a Linux machine, I remember having SyncTeX active in my Windows machine. It was a wonderful experience: SyncTeX lets you click anywhere on a generated file from LaTeX and gets back to your editor, to the place generating where you clicked. This was extremely useful, specially later on when you need to adjust many formulas to fit and you need a bit of back-and-forth-ing.</description>

I’m not a big soda fan (except when I’m on Finland in the Nordic Go Academy camp, they are so stocked on soda that I’m dragged in,) so my go-to drink is usually freshly squeezed lemonade with some ice cubes and sometimes a pinch of soda to make it fizz (and make it less acid.</description>

      <description>I have ve always loved maps. I guess it goes well with liking drawing and maths, there’s a deep connection (the pun is intended) between the subjects. As a map lover, when we decided to relocate to a somewhat more countryside town, I wanted better-looking maps to wander around the area. I checked government-issued maps, but they were either too large (scale 1:25000) or didn’t show the area I was interested (for the 1:10000 maps.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I started trying a pre-beta release of Dyalog APL (now available as &amp;ldquo;full beta&amp;rdquo;) for Mac. Fellow Mac users, looks like we are in for a treat after so much time of only having GNU APL and the pretty expensive APLX. Now Mac APL lovers, users and aficionados will have a competitive, commercial option. At last!
I started with the usual 1+1, ⍳ 10 , ⍴ ⍳ 10 to check it worked as expected.</description>

It all started after reading If you can’t choose, pick at random at Aeon.co. It delves into how choosing at random can be best in some cases. Give it a read, it is interesting. Among the HackerNews comments about this submission there were some mentions about choosing at random in real life, and to the novel The Dice Man (Amazon | Book Depository).</description>

This is not line noise, but a complete APL program to display the Mandelbrot set in glorious ASCII, with asterisks and spaces just like Brooks and Matelski did a long time ago while studying Kleinian groups (it&amp;rsquo;s a short paper, read it someday). I&amp;rsquo;ll explain in (a lot, I hope) detail this line in a few moments. So, what&amp;rsquo;s APL first?</description>

      <description>A few months ago (woah, so long already) I had an impulse buy: I purchased a circular slide rule from Etsy. It was cheap, and I had always wanted one, so… I just bought it (a neat addition to my Addiator.)
I guess if you are geeky enough to read mostlymaths.net, you know how a slide rule works. Although I knew how to use it, getting to grips with it took a little while.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I found myself with a problem. I wanted a reddit button in one of our websites, and our technical guy wanted it to be asynchronous. After a little poking around and deciding that reddit doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer asynchronous buttons, I rolled my poor man&amp;rsquo;s version: wrap it in a $(document).ready() It&amp;rsquo;s not asynchronous, but at least it won&amp;rsquo;t block page loading.
Both happy, we deployed and I tested.</description>

Beware! The software described here is just for personal and very light use. Its use beyond purely recreational value is against Google Search terms of service, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want you or anyone to step that line. Any use of this code is at your own risk.
Well, after this scary paragraph, lets get to the real meat. Which boils down to just a few lines of bash.</description>

      <description>Note: It&amp;rsquo;s best to open the videos in full screen. Also I have added a few line breaks or readability in the code snippets that will make them not work correctly. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to find where they are, if you run into any problems let me know.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following this blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll know I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Acme and related Plan 9 from User Space utilities lately. One of its pieces is the plumber.</description>

      <description>Text editors. You hate them or love them. Praise them with religious zeal, and attack them with the same power. I&amp;rsquo;ve been an emacs user for the last 8 years, getting as deep as I could without checking the source. And the past few months I have started using evil-mode in emacs, to get some taste of vim in my daily editing (mostly text objects.)
There&amp;rsquo;s still a third contestant in editor-land, for me.</description>

So&amp;hellip; last January I was in a flight to London, preparing for an intense, 12 days course on traditional shoemaking (English hand-welted shoes, improving our knowledge at The Fancy Puffin.) And my flight read was Practical Vim. Most of my readers are already aware I&amp;rsquo;m an emacs guy, so the main question is why?
I love knowing many tools.</description>

      <description>If you want to read a quick overview of this in Spanish, check my post about GTM at DoctorMetrics.
Google has just unveiled a new tool: Google Tag Manager. I have spent a few hours playing with it (both before and after official release.) And it&amp;rsquo;s awesome! Or at least, it has quite a lot of awesomeness, hidden behind a seemingly simple interface.
Its main feature is the fact that you can get away with just a piece of included code.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 6 years since I used some kind of version control system. Back
then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about which I wanted to use… I settled with RCS, the father
of them all. RCS was structurally simple, with text-based (human-readable) delta
files. I liked that. I had all my code and TeX files under revision control, but
then I started using more than one computer and it got out of hand quickly
(using RCS or CVS in Windows was quite tricky and had user and encoding
problems.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A few months ago I wrote about how I&amp;rsquo;m using vim in my ipad. You know, I&amp;rsquo;m an emacs guy, just started writing my own (useful) stuff to improve it. Recently I finished gnusnotes.el, a package which allows you to easily add notes to emails. Of course, before this I had already written emacs code, just that it was only for me.</description>

No, this is not a tutorial (but I do have written the standard steps to learn below). I began learning to juggle very recently. I just want to answer a possible &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;?
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by juggling, and every time I wanted to eat more than 2 small oranges I&amp;rsquo;d try my hand at juggling them. Always followed by bowing and picking them from the ground, of course.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about getting a new Macbook lately (my heart and wallet were divided among a 11&amp;quot; Air or a 15&amp;quot; Retina Pro). My 4-year old Macbook (Early 2008 I think, 2 GB Ram, Intel Core Duo 2.4 GHz) was showing its age. Mainly when I had the RAM and cache hungry inhabitants of my dock active: Yorufukurou (the best twitter client for managing multiple accounts in a Mac I&amp;rsquo;ve seen) and Sparrow (mail client).</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding a little more Python than usual, some twitter API stuff, some data crunching code. The other day I was thinking how I could detect the language a twitter user was writing in. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there is a library out there that does it… But the NLTK library (the Natural Language Toolkit for Python) does not have any function for this, or at least I was not able to find it after 5 minutes of Google search.</description>

      <description>Just in case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, vi is an advanced text editor, drting back from the same era as emacs was developed (emacs started slightly earlier). Sort of the Jekyll to emacs&#39; Dr Hyde. Emacs users despise vi users, and vi users mock emacs users. This is what the editor wars are all about: &amp;ldquo;Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;vi has two modes: writing and beeping&amp;rdquo;. If you have been long enough in this blog, you know I&amp;rsquo;m in the emacs side, but you also know I&amp;rsquo;m curious enough to delve into the other side.</description>

  In case you have not realised it yet, I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty prolific reader. Online reading (and having an iPad) have slowed down the number of books I read in a given year, and I don&amp;rsquo;t go to the lengths of my girlfriend (who is about to reach her goal of reading 102 books in this year,) I&amp;rsquo;m nevertheless a frequent reader.
This year I&amp;rsquo;ve read several good books that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you, after all, if you are reading this probably our tastes overlap.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing the game of Go (also known as weiqi or baduk) on and off for almost 10 years. In case you don’t know, Go is a board game with very old roots, that can be traced back to at least 2500 years ago, probably a lot more. Very popular in Japan (known as Go or Igo), Korea (baduk) and China (weiqi), it has been slowly spreading among the west during the last century.</description>

But this post is only mildly related to these books, since it started way before: the day I read about Gephi. Gephi is an open source graph visualization tool, to work with huge (or at least big) datasets and graphs.</description>

      <description>This was computed using PVM and the full PDF generated is 16k pixels wide
  Today is Iceland&amp;rsquo;s National Day (commemorating their independence day and the date of birth of Jón Sigurðsson), and to commemorate it I share this image with everyone.
I computed this image a long, long time ago (using the Distance Estimator Method, paralellised with PVM using 16 computers, it took just 2 minutes). The full file is a 30MB pdf, which I printed large-size (2 meters wide), and sits in my office.</description>

      <description>Snickerdoodles!
Do you have problems to keep motivated? Is your usual to-do list filled with great hopes of accomplishing 20 things? Do you dump it when you are wasted at 11 AM after finishing just the first 5 things? Of course, you are not alone. This is a very common thing, from freelancers to researchers, or to almost anyone managing their own time. But this can be due to eating radishes instead of chocolate chip cookies.</description>

      <description>As you may remember, yesterday we were not happy with our guest house. And in addition to what we saw yesterday, today our breakfast was d––n late. When you are driving around a country trying to be on time everywhere, you wake up early and drive a lot. If your breakfast is late, you are bound to either go faster (not a good idea in Iceland) or get to places later.</description>

As the congress was local, instead of using my netbook for the talk I brought my MacBook. Instead of using arrow keys, I could use these fancy Apple remotes. Good plan&amp;hellip; at the moment.</description>

      <description>From my cheap dictionary
I first heard of spaced repetition software around 5 or 6 years ago, while browsing around the net. Read about it, found it unappealing and moved on. You know, there are times when you learn about something and dismiss it as not necessary&amp;hellip; and after a while you are lead into it again to find it is wonderful. This is one of such instances.
I have only written two highly visited posts about languages: The Language Switch and How to Train Your Brain to Flip to a New Language (in Bitesize Irish Gaelic, it also appeared in Hacker Monthly, April 2011) and a lot of the commenters suggested me using Anki, Mnemosyne or Supermemo.</description>

Do you want to have very good memory? I do, in fact I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in it since my school days. There are some techniques that exploit your brain&amp;rsquo;s natural power, and the one I&amp;rsquo;m covering here is the memory palace technique.
I have already written about the memory palace memorisation technique (go and read the previous post if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about), but I did not cover a very important point there: Where can you find memory palaces to use in your memorisation?</description>

      <description>From my cheap dictionary
Last February I set myself a goal for these next three months (February, March and April): to learn Gaelic. The time is up and I must confess I have not made a lot of advances. The reasons are plenty, and most are shared with whoever wants to learn a new language. They are even harder for people learning a few languages at once, the kind of language nerds that have way too many Teach Yourself books on languages.</description>

Leaving Mývatn was a little dull. We saw a pair of handcraft stores that looked really interesting&amp;hellip; And they were closed until 11! No way we could spend so much time waiting. We fueled, bought vanillated skyr for the route and took the road to Dettifoss. This is one of those places where you definitely have to fuel, there is no other gas station in 130km.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I did nothing. Absolutely, really nothing.
 And it felt great. Before yesterday, my usual weekend was filled of what I thought was doing nothing, but far from it. I wrote posts, programmed, read a lot online and caught up with what was going in the A-List Blogger Club forum. Did some laundry, folded the clothes. All this (well, except for the laundry part) under the assumption that doing what you love does not tire you.</description>

      <description>An image can help your memory&amp;hellip;
For how long?
This is a method I use to complement the memory palace technique to remember facts, either historical, about people or any other subject. It is pretty simple and follows the same principles as the memory palace: you need to make up bizarre images. To memorise facts we just need to attach keys to each fact, and link them to the subject or person we are considering.</description>

In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll teach you how to have perfect recall of lists of items. Length is not much of an issue, it can be your shopping list if 10 items or it can be a list with 50, 100 or even 1000. And in a forthcoming post I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you how to apply this technique to learning new languages.</description>

We just made another round of Jökulsárlón icebergs while collecting shoreside rocks.

We spent almost all day in these two places and driving around, but they are probably two of the most remarkable experiences of our road trip in Iceland.

I have a confession to make: I&amp;rsquo;m not using emacs+org mode to keep my to-do list and appointments. What? The same emacs junkie that used emacs for (almost) everything last December gave up emacs? Yes, the same, but only gave up for this use case. I have some good reasons about why I am using TaskWarrior. Which does not mean that I could not be using emacs for the same, I just wanted to try something new.</description>

I guess there is not much need of an introduction for Steven. Just in case, Steven Pressfield is a best-selling author who started its career with The Legend of Bagger Vance and then started to write historical fiction, usually military themed. Some of his books (like Gates of Fire and Tides of War) have achieved cult status among military people, and they are even used as teaching material in some military schools.</description>

Wait, playing Dungeon Crawl

Installing Debian on the Ben is pretty easy after the work of the people at pyneo.org. I follow mostly their instructions which can befound here.
The first step is installing the package xburst-tools, following the instructions from the Qi Hardware Wiki about reflashing your Ben Nanonote.
The package can be downloaded in .deb format for Debian-like distributions.</description>

      <description>Next week is the final exam of the course I&amp;rsquo;m giving, Numerical Analysis. Classes finished before Christmas, and this week is for students questions. I had one of these sessions this morning, when a pair of students came with a few questions related to the problems I solved on the blackboard.
All were quick to solve, until one simple question arose, concerning a trivial problem in Calculus 1 (or Analysis 1, as we name it here).</description>

      <description>This is the notebook where I keep my to-do list, like the one you can see in the picture in Book Review: Do It Tomorrow. A quick and cheap way to have a small multi-page notebook you can keep always with you. Of course, calling this origami is a small lie, as you have to use scissors.
I read a very good post about going the analog way (How analog rituals can amp your productivity) and this was my tool.</description>

      <description>The gnus logo,
from gnus homepage
Ever since my first post of the emacs 30 Day Challenge, I was warned about gnus slowness. A lot of comments in reddit pointed to this, and suggested using wanderlust or installing a local IMAP server (like dovecot or notmuch) to speed up the IMAP back-end (search, retrieval and processing), while also allowing for offline reading.
The main drawback was keeping it nicely cross-platform.</description>

      <description>During this week you will hear and read a lot about New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions. Questions like what do you want to change in your life for the next year and what good habits do you want to build next year are assumed to be always in your mind now. And they should, but not just now.
New Year is only a psychological landmark, and a very bad one. Something like 70% of those good intentions you had while the previous year was ending fade into oblivion before February 1st.</description>

      <title>Do you Feel the Smell of Burning Wood? Pyrography Box Beta</title>

      <description>Santa brought me the gift I wanted for Christmas: a pyrograph. In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, a pyrograph is a tool to draw over wood, by burning it.
As you may already know, I love drawing (in particular, ink drawing). This is similar: you don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of control over tone and a mistake can ruin the drawing.
This was the first time I used one, and to test how it worked I decided to draw a Celtic knot over a wooden box.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s Friday afternoon after a long day and a long week. You board your train and are lucky to find a seat, soon it is crowded with people standing and chatting. You feel tired after the day, and think just about taking a late afternoon nap upon coming home.
But you plug your earphones, turn up the volume just until you can&amp;rsquo;t hear the train sounds and you are in another place.</description>

      <description>Keep your contacts
under control
Bbdb stands for The Insidious Big Brother Database, and is a very powerful contact book for emacs. It holds names, emails, aliases and other information and has good integration with gnus, wanderlust and vm (view mail). In my case, I have only checked gnus integration which is indeed pretty good.
This is the third installment in the set of posts for the emacs 30 Day Challenge: doing everything (as far as possible) from within emacs.</description>

      <description>The gnus logo,
from gnus homepage
When the time to choose a mail reader for emacs came, as part of my emacs 30 Day Challenge, there were not really a lot of options. A long, long time ago I had tried vm (view mail) with no luck. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the details (it was something like 3 years ago), but the results where unappealing. The only contenders where gnus and wanderlust.</description>

      <description>Below you can find a commented version of the LaTeX template I used to create two free ebooks and A6 booklets. Now you can tweak it as much as you like it!
The syntax highlighted TeX code comes from the htmlize package in emacs, to keep with my emacs 30 Day Challenge.
\\documentclass\[9pt,openany,final\]{memoir} % Set the font size with 9pt. Openany states that a chapter may start % in either page (recto or verso in publishing language).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll start giving configuration updates along the way, I&amp;rsquo;m still fiddling with them. You can check also my post about using gnus to read mail with Gmail.
Browsing with Conkeror The same day I started my 30 day challenge, the emacs focused blog emacs-fu posted a wonderful article highlighting the conkeror web browser (not to be confused with Konqueror, the standard browser in KDE based desktops).</description>

The Design of the Emacs Logo
As you may already know, emacs is more than a (cross-platform) text editor. Some say that it is like a whole operating system (and some devil worshippers say that it lacks a good text editor&amp;hellip;). For the next 30 days (starting December 1, 2010) I&amp;rsquo;ll check it as well as I can. I will work just with emacs.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I realised that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a printed copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Everymans-Library/dp/1101908009/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=art+of+war&amp;amp;qid=1566751724&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=rbersblog-20&amp;amp;linkId=7ba78e7bea92ff3a5828022f23de2d47&#34;&gt;Sun Tzu&amp;rsquo;s Art
of
War&lt;/a&gt;,
and this thought collided head on with another old thought I had: &lt;em&gt;could I use
&lt;code&gt;pdfpages&lt;/code&gt; to create A6 booklets?&lt;/em&gt; I use it frequently to turn my papers into
handy A4 booklets (a few A4 folded in half), butI did not know if I could do it
another time to generate A5 booklets, or even another time to get a small and
nice A6 booklet&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi readers! (woah&amp;hellip; 235 already! I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you&amp;rsquo;re here with me!)
This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Warsaw for a workshop (as I already commented in last post when I talked about the poster I am presenting).
I was expecting to use idle hours between talks and afternoons to write posts and post a little&amp;hellip; But my internet connection is inexistent. This post is coming from an open wifi connection, which gets connected and disconnected at random, and when at its peak, just makes 3Kb/s.</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;ll be in a workshop on Complex Dynamics in Warsaw, and will present a poster titled Approximating bifurcation loci by zeros of functions. This is heavily based on a poster I presented last year in Copenhagen (titled Sets approximating regions of instability). The underlying work in progress has changed quite a bit since then, but this does not show in the poster. I just solve some problems in the exposition, from the questions I got back then.</description>

Last week Laia and me went to a toy/book/stuff shop to buy a music stand. Practising guitar without a music stand was starting to feel rather odd. While we were there, we bought several more items, among them an old time favourite from myself: a mirror rubik cube. An addition to my keychain cube, SuperCube, 5x5 cube and Rubik dodecahedron. I had only seen it online, from Amazon.</description>

A pile of papers to read on the side. A stack of notes for several unrelated projects. Assignments to prepare. Questions to answer by email. Inbox full of unclassified mails. Lectures to prepare. Cluttered office desktop. Cluttered computer desktop.
A few weeks ago, Friday, this was what I saw when I looked at my office desktop. And I decided it was too much to bear and filed my first Task Bankruptcy.</description>

GillesGonthier@Flickr
A few weeks ago I realised I was procrastinating too much. I tend to work in cycles, and it looked like my productive cycle was over and my procrastinator half had just kicked in the worse possible moment: lectures had just begun.
It looked like there was no solution. My timeboxing strategies went nowhere, will-do lists (litemind.com) had no real meaning, carrot-and-stick solutions didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

I just realised why I procrastinate in some tasks. And it may also be why you do, read on! It is not because they are boring, hard or repetitive. They may be. Hard tasks are a measure of your strength, boring and repetitive tasks, of your stamina. No, the problem is another.
Some projects are just tombstones. There are certain huge projects, with hardness and boredom along the way that when they are done, they are dead.</description>

If I had to gamble before going to Iceland, I would have thought tap water would be horrible.</description>

      <title>Limiting Factors: Biology Enters Time Management</title>

      <description>What? Biology and time management? Limiting factors? Okay, take it easy. First, let&amp;rsquo;s read this Wikipedia entry:
 A limiting factor or limiting resource is a factor that controls a process, such as organism growth or species population, size, or distribution. The availability of food, predation pressure, or availability of shelter are examples of factors that could be limiting for an organism. An example of a limiting factor is sunlight in the rainforest, where growth is limited to all plants in the understory unless more light becomes available.</description>

First I would like to say you one thing about Iceland&amp;rsquo;s food: don&amp;rsquo;t be scared! They don&amp;rsquo;t eat anything odd, except for a few national foods which are not that usual: hákari (rotten shark meat) and hrutspungar (pickled ram testicles).</description>

      <description>A nice warm Sunday afternoon, I wanted something cold to drink and a good book to read in my garden. I glanced at my pile of books beside the door, the books I grab to read in the train to my office, a pile of 8 books. Then I remembered I had a few books in the library I wanted to read, another pile, 10 books. As I went down and put them all over the table, I realised I had a few books more in the computer room, 3 books.</description>

      <description>Interesting things to know before going to Iceland As you may remember, Laia and myself went to Iceland for a 2 and half weeks trip last June-July. It was a wonderful experience, managed by the wonderful (and helpful!) people at Nordic Visitor. This is the first post in a series named Things you should read before travelling to Iceland.

      <guid>https://mostlymaths.net/2010/08/get-yacas-in-ben-nanonote.html/</guid>
      <description>Yacas is an advanced computer algebra system, with its own programming language and a lot of handful operators available.
It comes handy when you need to do that odd symbolic computation which is too big to handle by hand (or you are plain lazy).
By looking at the wikipedia entry, I discovered an startling truth: as of 2009, yacas is no longer maintained.
I should have guessed, because yacas does not compile out of the box (the program needed to generate the manuals does not compile), and this led to some naïve patching (just removing all instances of said program&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>A month ago, Oscar del Ben posted an interesting tip in his blog to take power naps when you are feeling tired, How to Get a Quick 5-10 Minutes Nap Without Using an Alarm Clock. His idea is simple: pick a spoon on your hand. Once you fall asleep, your grip will relax, the spoon falls and you awaken with the sound. I found it amusing and interesting, as I am one of those types who feel really well after a 10 minutes nap.</description>

      <description>Last Tuesday I made the move. I ditched Ubuntu and installed Arch Linux in my Acer Aspire One. After my post Linux is a time killer (which attracted a lot of attention, and didn&amp;rsquo;t really carry the message I wanted) I got a lot of comments to think about. The two most suggested Linux distributions were Debian/unstable and Arch Linux. Well, maybe Arch Linux was not that talked about, but the following comment bought me out:</description>

      <description>I have a problem: I know quite a lot different programming languages (you can read my list of the best 9 books I have read about programming), but I am proficient only in two. I&amp;rsquo;d love to choose a few to concentrate and build my skills up, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know which. Read on for background and possible candidates.
Since I discovered there were different programming languages, I&amp;rsquo;ve liked learning different ones.</description>

      <description>Preface: I have been using Linux since around 1998, when I installed Debian from scratch in my old Pentium II. I am more end-user than power user, but the computer I use most often (my netbook) has Linux in it by default. Also, my office computer is a Linux computer. And I am writing this in my MacBook. Which is not Linux, but at least it is Unix. What comes now is a personal rant, after a fight with my netbook.</description>

      <description>Three months ago Oscar Del Ben posted an interesting post in his blog, FreestyleMind. In it he said that he saved (quite) a lot of money and a lot of back pain with a special office chair: he uses a gym ball.
The gym ball in question is the one used in yoga or Pilates training. They come in two sizes, 65 cm 75cm (diameter). I had recurring back pain, and decided to give it a try at home.</description>

      <description>As I posted in Best Posts I Have Read in June and July, I liked a lot a numerical experiment in Re: Factor, a blog about learning the Factor programming language. The idea comes from another blog, this time about Clojure (a Lisp dialect running in the Java Virtual Machine), based on a footnote from Prime Obsession (Amazon affiliate link) by John Derbyshire. The footnote reads:

      <description>I just want to introduce you Fatou, our little cat.

I like napping in the sofa
We adopted him last Saturday, and he is 2 months old. He is named after French mathematician Pierre Fatou&amp;hellip; Mostly because Laia didn&amp;rsquo;t want him to be named Kolmogorov, and Fatou was the first mathematician name she liked.
He is very cute (as you can see), and well-mannered. Last Monday he had to go to the veterinary clinic for a revision, and the vet told us it is amazing how good he is: he even wears his collar!</description>

 Hanselminutes is a weekly audio talk show with noted web developer and technologist Scott Hanselman and hosted by Carl Franklin. Scott discusses utilities and tools, gives practical how-to advice, and discusses ASP.</description>

It depends if you are going to an almost unmarked farm where you will spend the night or just in the middle of an unending straight road. And in the boredom moments, I decided to compile a list of things we had packed and were really useful. I hope this helps you in your next trip!

But I thought: if I can have a neat CD case, I can also design a neat origami case for an iPhone! Said and&amp;hellip; done. It took a few tries (and a few days), as you can see below.</description>

If you are an avid self-improvement reader, you know already what timeboxing is. But maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t harness all its potential For the rest, timeboxing is a time management technique focused on time spent, not tasks done. Therefore, you will need to set aside some project tracking system to have a clear idea of what you are working on.</description>

      <description>Today I am leaving on holiday&amp;hellip; Destination: Iceland. It is funny, because we arranged everything (accomodation, car rental and such) just two weeks before Eyjafjallajökull started spitting ash. It have been a few months wondering whether we could make it to Iceland and come back&amp;hellip; Fortunately the little volcano took a pause and here we go.
I have a few scheduled posts for this few weeks (I&amp;rsquo;ll be back around 16th July) but I will be again posting more frequently after I am back.</description>

      <description>One inbox to rule them all Since I started printing everything in A5 booklet format, more and more articles and printed stuff gets scattered over my desk, in this format. Which is really handy for reading and travelling, but not so much for piling over the desk.
A pile of inner stapled A5 is slightly womb&amp;hellip; when there are more than 5 big documents stacked, it can easily fall. And I had several piles over my desktop: To read someday (better sooner than later), current references (papers I am using more than twice a week or so) and past references (the ones that were in the previous category but have not used in a while).</description>

      <description>Most of you may not know who Vladimir Arnold (Владимир Арнольд, also written as Vladimir Arnol&amp;rsquo;d) was, but for me his death on 3rd June 2010,was some kind of landmark. I own two books by him (Mathematical aspects of classical and celestial mechanics [1] and Mathematical methods of classical mechanics [2]), and are quite high in my list of most checked books, at least when I was starting my journey into the realm of dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I found this recipe via StumbleUpon. I had two apples I would not eat, and decided to give it a go. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t have oatmeal, so I improvised. This is my version, which I call Crispy Apple Pie.
If you have ever been to Denmark, they eat something named Æblekage. I ate it last November, and I loved it. This is very, very similar&amp;hellip; with a little whipped cream it would be almost the same.</description>

      <description>A week without writing here. A week with little thesis related work done. But it has also been a week with ideas and things and such. You know, two weeks ago I was in Dresden for a conference. Lots of parallel sessions, and quite a few time to think. This post is mostly a digest from my life bookmarks for these two weeks.
Several complex dynamic ideas: Unrelated to my thesis, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about them these days.</description>

bread.&lt;/p&gt;

Google answered with this page, and it was interesting enough to deserve an apt-get install. And indeed, it is great! Usually, when I have some straight text file I need to print, I use emacs old postscript-print-buffer, which is nice, but not as nice as all options a2ps has.</description>

      <title>Life bookmarking and why it could change how you learn</title>

      <description>Life logging, journaling&amp;hellip; what now? The idea behind this post grew from an insight I had, two months ago. I realised that I was bookmarking a lot of web pages because I liked what they explained and wanted to remember what I read. More precisely, I wanted to remember that I had read that. At that time, this seemed the more natural way to approach this problem.
A month later, more or less, I landed in this New York times article: The Data-Driven Life.</description>

      <description>New and old
For around 4/5 years I have been the proud owner of a Canon Ixus 30. A small and versatile pocket digital camera. But I missed a lot being able to tweak some settings, having manual focus, aperture and exposition controls is fantastic. Moreover, it shoots in RAW.
Using it is quite easy if you have used a previous Canon model and if you have ever touched a digital reflex.</description>

      <description>Today, while I was thinking of the best implementation solution for the vector operations, I realised that I am just not motivated by writing a raytracer in Forth. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to find something more interesting, or at least, more Forth minded to work on.
If I want to raytrace, better to improve the Lisp raytracer, which is sitting idly in my Code/Lisp folder. Steps that will follow in the raytracer path:</description>

      <description>Yes, I know it: it is easy. But I will be doing a wipe and reinstall of my MacBook, and when I need to reinstall everything I want a place to check for the steps I did. I found almost all tips needed here.
The first step is checking for Mercurial (wikipedia) in your system. Open a terminal and type
 hg version
 If your terminal complains about command not found, you don&amp;rsquo;t have Mercurial installed.</description>

      <description>Last saturday I was in a porting mood, and tackled two interesting packages to have in the Ben NanoNote: yacas and 4th.
Yacas (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a very interesting application to have in such a small device. The best calculator I have used is my old faithful HP49g. But in these days, it is bulky, heavy and slow. It was superseded by m48 (a HP48+ emulator) inside my iPod Touch.</description>

      <description>Do you own a Mac? I use both MacOS and Linux everyday, and found myself with a problem. Before I found Shutter taking screenshots in Linux felt like a PITA. In MacOS you can take region screenshots by pressing Cmd-Shift-4. And I missed this feature in Linux, until I cared enough to look for a solution.
Shutter was the answer, an open source screenshot grabber that fills my needs, and probably yours too.</description>

      <description>Fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals. Everyone knows it, fundamentals are fundamental. It&amp;rsquo;s like saying water is wet, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? But again and again the greatest teachers of hard disciplines remind us that we need to master the fundamentals to become the best.
Vince Lombardi, said it:
 Fundamentals win it. Football is two things; it&amp;rsquo;s blocking and tackling. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about formations or new defences or tricks on defence. If you block and tackle better than the team you&amp;rsquo;re playing, you&amp;rsquo;ll win.</description>

      <description>The 23rd of April is a very special day in Catalonia. The legend of Saint George, in the Catalan version happens in a small town called Montblanc, and when the knight kills the Dragon from its spilled blood grows a red rose he gave to the princess. Since medieval times, men give their a rose to his significant other, and in 1923 something was added to this story.
A bookseller wanted to spice the celebration, and as Miguel de Cervantes and William Shakespeare died on this same day, he promoted the giving of books as a present.</description>

 You arrive to your office. Quickly check urgent mails, close the mail program and browser and put a nice solid hour, hour and a half, even two straight hours of work. Then decide that you deserve a break, and maybe with a fresh cup of coffee from the coffee machine you decide to browse idly for a few minutes. And then a co-worker knocks at your door and asks if you are coming to lunch.</description>

      <description>The Ben NanoNote has very few applications, as of now. And one it has (among a few nice others), is Gcal. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what Gcal was, and the Qi hardware wiki page on Gcal pointed me to this quite nice tutorial: The many uses of Gcal.
The tutorial is quite good, but somewhat long, and lacks a few specific examples, so I decided to write just what I read in that tutorial, mixed with the uses I am putting it to, so it is more a Gcal use cases than a full blown tutorial like that.</description>

Since I bought the Nanonote, I have been finding new uses for it. Music player, note taker, voice recorder. I can also use it to start learning Python again, or Perl, which are (together with Lua) the languages currently installed by default.
After my first successful port (gnugo), I decided to try something else, and while idling at the train I thought that pMARS, the portable Memory Array Redcode Simulator was probably a good bet.</description>

      <description>As I promised in my previous post reasons for re-inventing the wheel as a programmer, here I collect 8 reader reasons for re-inventing the wheel from comments on the reddit thread and on page comments. They are in no particular order AFAIK.
  You need a faster wheel: Embedded software is the prime example of such. Average 10 cycles, worst case 15 cycles is not good when your system can explode if you do not attain 14 cycles at most.</description>

I discovered commandlinefu.com a few years ago, while looking for a way to do&amp;hellip; something. I don&amp;rsquo;t even enter that often, although it is a brilliant place to discover how to do X in Linux/UNIX.
Among its all time greats I found some gems, and some others I discovered elsewhere, or even I made up.</description>

      <description>The &amp;lsquo;broken windows theory&amp;rsquo; is a widely known theory, based on folks knowledge (which have been also tested in real life).
 Consider a building with a broken window. If this window does not get repaired, other windows can break (over time, or by vandalism). In the long run, someone may break into the building, becoming a squatter.
Or a more usual situation. If some litter gets accumulated in a sidewalk or a lot, soon more litter will accumulate, until people start leaving whole bags of trash.</description>

David Reyes, from Tuxbrain did a great work by porting gnuchess to the Nano and documenting it in his blog.
Of course, I want to port big things, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a great Linux guy, just average, so this tutorial makes a great starting point.</description>

      <description>Has someone ever told you &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t re-invent the wheel&amp;rdquo;? Again and again I read somewhere around the net that &amp;rsquo;re-inventing the wheel&#39; is one of the worse errors a programmer can fall into. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve read it so often that the only thought of doing it makes me re-think over and over other ways of solving (or ignoring) the problem.
But here, I advocate my pro&amp;rsquo;s (the cons can be found elsewhere) for re-inventing the wheel, or at least not being frightened of it.</description>

      <description>It is a widely accepted theory that the use of tools determined the development of the human brain. Nowadays, using tools is thus a quite common endeavor everybody does.
But ask a carpenter if he would use a jagged saw, or a draftsman a broken pencil. It is not only using the tools, but using the best tools.
But what is for the best tools? Using the best possible tools is not enough: you need to love your tools.</description>

      <description>As I wrote in a previous post, I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to learn forth, and to do so, rewrite my Lispy raytracer into a.. Forthy raytracer. Of course, the first steps are deciding on some implementation ideas.
I decided to allocate a few global variables (for &amp;ldquo;current point&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;current vector&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;light source&amp;rdquo;, etc), to avoid too much clutter in the stack. This way it will be cleaner, maybe even cleaner than my Lisp version.</description>

      <description>After following a twitter feed about programming, I got overwhelmed by FORTH related posts. I had already read something about forth before (stack-based, somewhat fast, good for embedded devices), but so many bit.ly links pointing to webs of implementations of FORTH and FORTH things made me decide to, well, take a deeper look.
Looks like a nice language, having something I enjoy about Lisp (interactivity) and something I like about PostScript (stack based).</description>

      <description>The easiest way to debug: valgrind with the most powerful text editor: emacs A few days ago my office mate told me about the great debugging tool known as valgrind. Before I have been using the great pairing of emacs+gdb to debug segmentation faults and memory leaks&amp;hellip; Now I would never use gdb for this. Moreover, I found a way to somewhat use it from within a shell in emacs to allow fast error browsing.</description>

      <description>Maybe you remember my previous post about detection of copied assignments? Well, now I can say it succeeded. CJuicer is a flex script, generating a lexycal analyzer with a rudimentary parser of C code, it outputs a PostScript with the &amp;ldquo;logical tree&amp;rdquo; of loops, function calls and conditionals. Same trees, copied assignment (unless it is simple code, then almost everyone writes the same), without problems with changing names of variables. Thus it could beat diff.</description>

      <description>This is where Linux started. Minix, from the bible on operating systems. You can easily install it on minivMac for your iPod, download it from this link and install the disk image in your iPod as usual. Then, unpack the files inside.

Fifteen minutes later&amp;hellip;

When unpacking is finished, just open the MacMinix app, and Minix will be up and running.

By the way, the username for MacMinix is root, and the password is Geheim!</description>

A few months ago, I realised I was checking some pages frequently for changes. They were some congress pages, and I was waiting for them to add information about registration and such.
Then I realised I could write a script to do it, using diff and wget. You can get it below. You have to edit it to add the pages you want to follow, then run it with the &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; option to download the first version, then edit your crontab file (crontab -e) to run it every day at a specified time with the &amp;ldquo;diff&amp;rdquo; option.</description>

ScummVM is self-described as a collection of game engine recreations, and is available for several platforms (Mac, Windows and Linux at least&amp;hellip; also several handhelds and game consoles). For me, its main use is to replay old LucasArts graphical adventures.</description>

You know, SVN, CVS, Git, Darcs. As I was just a single user working locally (just wanted the incremental and logged backups), I installed RCS. Almost the oldest, and in some sense the most simple. It can work locally, just with a file of delta (text added from one revision to the next) which is a plain text, human readable file.</description>

I am working in my free time in an image processing related program, and this made me remember when I was taking a course in Signal Processing. One of the standard test images was the one above. Where does this historical image processing snippet come from?
Turns out (wikipedia link) it is a standard folklore image, dating back to the seventies, when a bunch of electrical engineers needed an image satisfying certain signal problems (it is, indeed, an image with a lot of significative details, when compressing, denoising or whatever: the hat, the uniform colour distribution except for a few patches of different color&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>As I said in a previous post, I am looking for some way to detect copied code. I have now a working prototype of a &amp;ldquo;code juicer&amp;rdquo;. From a C file it creates a set of PostScript files (well, almost, as they need postprocessing) which are later processed and selected to print. As an example, here is the output applied to a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4-5.

It is something like an execution tree, with function calls squared, and different slopes for if, for, while clauses.</description>

From my point of view, there are fundamentally two different kinds of copy:</description>

      <description>With Sketchbook Mobile
The concepts of &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;job stability&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;location&amp;rdquo; are quite fuzzy when in Mathematics. I think I don&amp;rsquo;t know any PhD student who knows what he will be doing in 3 years, what he will be working on (not what he will be researching, but working&amp;hellip;) or even where he will be.
  1-2 years of Master+Master thesis
  2-6 years of PhD thesis (3-4 years PhD grant+maybe some associated professor, 1-4 years)</description>

      <description>Althouh I use AucTeX, which already has nice quick-writing techniques, I have found emacs&#39; abbrev-mode together with skeletons are a nice addition to it, allowing me to be really quick at writing LaTeX. The included examples to use dabbrev and skeletons are for the mathbb and theorem environments.
Sample usage: When I write \mbb, and then open the left {, mbb gets expanded to mathbb&amp;hellip; so I have \mathbb{ as needed.</description>

But&amp;hellip; of course, the machine scans two pages each time, and thus creates a double bound PDF.
And this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well with my way to print booklets, so a working solution was to use ghostscript and ImageMagick from the command line.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t even tell how wonderful it is, to share the source with the images with the formulas. An image is worth more than a googol words.</description>

The images don&amp;rsquo;t look like much, but the output of the program is nicer: it outputs an Encapsulated PostScript file which looks sharper. But when converting to png with ImageMagick some distortion appeared.

      <description>Two and a half weeks ago, I got a netbook and promptly installed Ubuntu, followed by Fluxbox (as already explained). And after two weeks of almost continued use, I like it even more than when I decided to use it. Some of the points I really enjoy (in no particular order).
 Strong keyboard shortcuts. As an emacs junkie as I am, I love keyboard shortcuts. And Fluxbox is incredibly flexible in defining or removing them: Even system-wide shortcuts are customizable.</description>

This means quite a lot of hand-written papers, full of definitions and on top of it all a lot of notational problems. I have quite a few similarly named spaces, with its corresponding norms&amp;hellip; It is a mess.
When I had already proved my &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; theorem (in the thesis context, I mean&amp;hellip; I have a paper soon to be published :), I started LaTeXing it.</description>

      <description>I feel like I contributed something. I rewrote Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s Siegel disk page, adding references and images. It is now quite dense&amp;hellip; Ill have to re-read it to simplify it several times. Or someone else&amp;hellip; Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s wonders.

Back when I was in school, I had a really nice game in my 80286 computer, under Windows 3.1. Yes, it was 15 years ago&amp;hellip; The game was Hyperoid, by Edward Hutchins. When I got my first Pentium with Windows 95, I longed that game&amp;hellip; and the 3.1. version didn&amp;rsquo;t work completely OK in it. Anyway I played&amp;hellip; then found Hyperoid95. I even recompiled it, to add firepower (the author of this version cut the fire speed).</description>

      <description>This evening I was bored at home, and decided to have a look at my old Lisp raytracer… a project that just went idle a year ago. I picked up another programming project I had idling for a long time (an emacs lisp project, to interact with my console-based fractal drawers). I had a coding breakthrough that time, and managed to advance quite a bit in a little time, so today I tried again.</description>

I guess life (or at least a mathematician&amp;rsquo;s life while doing his thesis) is more or less like this&amp;hellip; Enemies appear, you overcome them, and as you advance, they get stronger, bigger and thicker.</description>

Rasterbator is an online poster maker, for you to print in your own printer. Of course, the results are not as good as full quality posters like these, but they look pretty good when looked from afar. It rasterises an image you upload (or link from anywhere in Internet), does some magic stuff, and the result is a bunch (you decide graphically how many, orientation and other options) of A4 (or Legal) sheets arranged in a nice PDF, which you have to print.</description>

It is based in a method developed by professor Dalmau, based on catalan fonology. Once you are able to write in this way, you enjoy it more and more, is quite an interesting feeling.

Although it is a quick and neat design for an origami case, I don&amp;rsquo;t like it, it feels like the CD is about to fall. So I tweaked for a while, and came up with this design. It takes a little longer to fold, but holds really firm, and looks nicer after.</description>

It is a single html document you download, and save. And it behaves (locally, in your computer!) just as a wiki. Creating links, adding things, whatever you like. Use it like a blog, wiki, recipe book, sketchpage, whatever you like. All gets saved in the same html file you downloaded (advise: change its name).

      <description>For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, PostScript is a programming language (and also the name of the type of files you write in this language) used as a way to define what a page looks like. A PostScript file contains instructions which create text, or draw images, and these instructions can do quite a lot of work. PostScript is directly processed by almost all laser printers, and if you are a Linux or MacOs user you already have some mean to process and open it.</description>

To do so, I kept on procrastinating (avoiding my work) to research the web for causes, cures and pitfalls in this &amp;ldquo;disease&amp;rdquo;. In the following entry I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you everything I&amp;rsquo;ve learned (slightly condensed), hope it serves you too. Keep in mind it is a long post, bookmark it now if you can&amp;rsquo;t keep reading for this long (or use it to avoid working for about half an hour :) I will only cover the aspects of causes (and related cures) and related time management systems, but for now I will skip motivation, leaving it for another post, as I&amp;rsquo;m still thinking about it.</description>

      <description>In Catalan, we have a curious expression, &amp;ldquo;fer dissabte&amp;rdquo;, which could be translated as do the Saturday, or make Saturday as I have in the title.

This neat bookmarks appear in the far bottom of every post, and allow to bookmark the current post in any of these websites (Digg, Reddit, del.icio.us, Facebook, technorati, Google and StumbleUpon). With autocompletion of the url and title, sure.

      <title>How to create LaTeX booklets</title>

      <description>If you are printing a lot of… well, anything, sure you would love to make booklets out of what you print. If you happen to be a mathematician, you sure are printing lots of papers with more than 20 pages, which turn to 10 unmanageable pages when double-sided. But making a booklet allows you to turn them to just a little folded thing that you can read easier.
When printing in MacOSX you can print booklets, but they are supposed to be cut, not folded across as you would do to bind a book.</description>

      <description>Name one great asset to your cupboard. One you can put in a pizza, in almost every salad, you can make omelets out of it, can put over a toast and could be a side dish to almost every meal you can think of. Well, sun dried tomatoes come close to it. Tasty, nice and they smell as good you get hungry just opening the jar. Well, they are really easy to do at home, with just your oven!</description>

      <description>Today I read through Slashdot an article from the NY Times, where they show a correlation between number of good-level research articles and consumption of beer in the Czech Republic. More beer, less articles. It is still unclear if just bad (czech) scientists drown their sorrows in beer (not all of them, of course), and there are also a lot of counterexamples. Just a bizarre article.
This made me think of a former article I read there, talking about student-advisor (as a side note, adviser and advisor are both accepted in English, amazing) problems.</description>

      <description>Browsing old posts in Origami Tessellations, I found out about Joel Cooper&amp;rsquo;s origami masks. Here are a few examples taken from these two web pages.
 
They are really amazing&amp;hellip; I hope I can learn how to do that. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to start learning something about origami tessellations, which is a thing I&amp;rsquo;ve always skipped.</description>

      <description>This weekend I bought three books:
Bill Evans: How My Heart Sings (Bill Evans: Vida y Obra), Martian Chronicles, by Ray Bradbury (Crónicas Marcianas) and The Lebanese Cookbook (a spanish edition). I have already finished Bradbury&amp;rsquo;s, I enjoyed it a lot. A masterpiece in science-fiction. In one of its short stories there is a poem by Lord Byron:
 So we&amp;rsquo;ll go no more a roving

      <description>A few years ago, I was looking after some song lyrics (don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly which song they belong to), and went into some of these web&amp;rsquo;s that give you &amp;ldquo;you may also like this&amp;rdquo; links. Well, I looked into the lyrics of &amp;ldquo;For Crying Out Loud&amp;rdquo;, by Meat Loaf (who I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard about, ever). This are the lyrics, and as almost all Steinman&amp;rsquo;s-Meat Loaf songs, they are quite long. Just read the first few verses if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like reading:</description>

      <description>Kamiya Satoshi&amp;rsquo;s Pegasus, folded from a square from A4 standard paper (21x21 cm square). The model is about 8 cm long. Satoshi suggests 25x25 paper, which obviously must be thinner than 80g/m^2. But the model itself is wonderful, although my rendition of may not be worth of it.
PS: Shame on me, for not rendering the head as it must be done (à la Dave Brill&amp;rsquo;s horse). Well, next time, with bigger paper :)</description>

      <description>As you may already know, I enjoy a lot drawing. I usually draw with some kind of mechanical pencil, of HB strength (or one for film writing which is stronger than 3H). As I try to improve the quality of my drawings, I begin to wonder if I really like to draw really well. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to draw perfect faces, but probably I&amp;rsquo;ll be as happy being able to sketch a face that looks like the original one.</description>

      <description>What could I say about this movie? Definitely the best science fiction film of all time. A funny sentence Leon said Deckard before dying:
Leon:
My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard:
Four years.
Leon:
More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard:
Oh, I agree.
Leon:
Wake up! Time to die.</description>

      <description>A month or so ago I went to Cafes El Magnífico (sadly doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with Firefox), a nice coffee dealer near the cathedral to buy me some good coffee. Cristina wanted also some tea, and in front of C.E.M there is Sans &amp;amp; Sans Fine Tea, so it is the perfect place for us. I bought 250g of coffee from Java, an island in Indonesia. They told me it is good with milk and also alone, and indeed it is.</description>

      <description>From 5 November to 9 November took place the (second) Fall School in Holomorphic Dynamics. Three fine speakers came (Walter Bergweiler, Agnieszka Badenska and Kari Astala), each one giving a course about a different topic in 3 sessions of one hour and a half. The only course I completed was the one Walter was giving, as it was the most interesting for me.
I talked on monday afternoon, but my talk was a mess.</description>

      <description>This blog was started on this day, and was written in Catalan until mid-2007. On August 22nd, 2019 I moved from Blogger, my original blogging platform to GitHub pages. Since the readership has shifted to English speakers and the interest of the early posts is low (also, I had to port the posts to another format…) I deleted a great deal (around 350, out of the 670 I had at migration time) of the earliest posts.</description>
