<br/></p>
<p>As part of my end of year rituals, I clean up/groom my reading list, emails, open tabs, books, courses… The most relevant change so far is that my reading list is gone from <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things 3</a> to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. One big advantage of Obsidian is that I can better track (and plot) its size, which is something I always like to have monitored. This means that at some point I&rsquo;ll need to tweak the code that helps me write these posts relatively quickly (<a href="https://github.com/rberenguel/hweekly">hweekly</a> and a <a href="https://taskfile.dev/#/">taskfile</a> inside the private repository)</p>

<p>I tried something with the new temporal logic operators in Alloy, as an extension to my previous post about <a href="https://mostlymaths.net/2021/05/data-pipelines-alloy.html/">modelling data pipelines</a>. I didn&rsquo;t get any useful insight, aside of how easy writing Alloy models can be.</p>

<p>It has been mostly good. Maybe a bit &ldquo;too much kanban&rdquo; for my tastes, but it has been interesting and many of the ideas could apply regardless of your development flavour.</p>

<h2 id="is-invasive-species-dining-the-next-frontierhttpswwwsaveurcomfoodeating-invasive-species"><a href="https://www.saveur.com/food/eating-invasive-species/">Is Invasive Species Dining The Next Frontier?</a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit puzzling to find a picture (mid-article) of Jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes, or <em>tupinambos</em> as we know them in Catalonia). They are just &ldquo;mildly&rdquo; invasive (i.e. like mint is actually invasive, it will basically take over anything you have around). At home we definitely love their taste, depending on how you prepare them they suggest sunflower seeds, or artichoke hearts. Problem is, they can produce really, really severe, let&rsquo;s say, bloating 🍑💨💨.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find RudderStack (an open-source-ish &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; for Segment) using Postgres for all its queueing capabilities, but then I saw a link explaining the reasoning: It&rsquo;s what Segment does, but they use MySQL (in RDS).</p>

<p>I bought the book 1h15' after getting the email letting me know it was finished. As a somewhat long time reader of Li Haoyi&rsquo;s blog posts I knew it was going to be good. It took me somewhat longer to read it (basically until I got a Remarkable 2) and it definitely has been a good one.</p>

<p>THE F*&amp;%!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JBIG2 doesn&rsquo;t have scripting capabilities, but when combined with a vulnerability, it does have the ability to emulate circuits of arbitrary logic gates operating on arbitrary memory. So why not just use that to build your own computer architecture and script that!? That&rsquo;s exactly what this exploit does. Using over 70,000 segment commands defining logical bit operations, they define a small computer architecture with features such as registers and a full 64-bit adder and comparator which they use to search memory and perform arithmetic operations. It&rsquo;s not as fast as Javascript, but it&rsquo;s fundamentally computationally equivalent.</p>

<p>A bit late, I&rsquo;m doing my annual clean-up of articles I may want to read-and-forget before the new year. I find of particular interest the streaming-tables-to-delta-lake, since it sounds as if it makes it extremely easy to convert streaming sources (as in Kafka) into nicely coalesced Parquet files.</p>

<p>I do own a ReMarkable 2 (and also heavily used IA Writer for a while). In the end, you need to have something to say, I have found. The RM2 is extremely useful as a reading device for large size PDFs (like research papers, or technical books) but I don&rsquo;t like it that much for writing notes. I tried for a long while (you won&rsquo;t need a notebook ever again!) but it didn&rsquo;t fit my &ldquo;feeling&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Sounds like an extreme amount of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>, particularly to fix no problem in particular (the introductory issue is totally a non-problem I think). On the other hand, using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/turtle">turtle</a> to write shell scripts seems more interesting and useful.</p>

<p>Sad, looks like we won&rsquo;t have Kafka ported to Scala 3 (itself) until Scala 3.something due to Java-Scala interop enhancements that have been lost between Scala 2.13.x and early Scala 3.</p>

<p>For some years I have been thinking that SQLite is a great &ldquo;data exchange format&rdquo; as well as an efficient way to keep data in sync.
